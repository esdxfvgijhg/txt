The purpose of this meting was to talk about our approach to use genetic algorithm to select the LoRa transmission setting that best fit the application requirements.
Beside this,
	we talked about the ability to adapt this work to a building application and particularly to track persons, objects in a construction site.
Clustering algorithms could be helpful in this kind of application 

Because allows devices to be located and placed in  in based on their
