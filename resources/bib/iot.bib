  abstract = {In this paper, we present results of a study of the data rate fairness among nodes within a LoRaWAN cell. Since LoRa/LoRaWAN supports various data rates, we firstly derive the fairest ratios of deploying each data rate within a cell for a fair collision probability. LoRa/LoRaWAN, like other frequency modulation based radio interfaces, exhibits the capture effect in which only the stronger signal of colliding signals will be extracted. This leads to unfairness, where far nodes or nodes experiencing higher attenuation are less likely to see their packets received correctly. Therefore, we secondly develop a transmission power control algorithm to balance the received signal powers from all nodes regardless of their distances from the gateway for a fair data extraction. Simulations show that our approach achieves higher fairness in data rate than the state-of-art in almost all network configurations.},

  abstract = {As LoRaWAN networks are actively being deployed in the field, it is important to comprehend the limitations of this Low Power Wide Area Network technology. Previous work has raised questions in terms of the scalability and capacity of LoRaWAN networks as the number of end devices grows to hundreds or thousands per gateway. Some works have modeled LoRaWAN networks as pure ALOHA networks, which fails to capture important characteristics such as the capture effect and the effects of interference. Other works provide a more comprehensive model by relying on empirical and stochastic techniques. This work uses a different approach where a LoRa error model is constructed from extensive complex baseband bit error rate simulations and used as an interference model. The error model is combined with the LoRaWAN MAC protocol in an ns-3 module that enables to study multi channel, multi spreading factor, multi gateway, bi-directional LoRaWAN networks with thousands of end devices. Using the lorawan ns-3 module, a scalability analysis of LoRaWAN shows the detrimental impact of downstream traffic on the delivery ratio of confirmed upstream traffic. The analysis shows that increasing gateway density can ameliorate but not eliminate this effect, as stringent duty cycle requirements for gateways continue to limit downstream opportunities.},
  annotation = {In order to tackle the interference and capture effect,\\
an error model is described in \textbackslash{}cite\{abeele\_scalability\_2017\}.\\
This model is used for determining the range between EDs and a GW as well as analyzing the interference among various concurrent communications.\\
The algorithm considers three different methods for assigning an efficient SF:\\
(i) a random assignment method which assigns SFs based on uniform distribution mechanism,\\
(ii) a fixed assignment method which assigns the same SFs all the time during the simulation period,\\
(iii) Packet Error Rate (PER) based which finds and allocates the lowest SF for which the PER falls under a certain threshold.\\
The PER approach for finding a suitable SF performs better than both the random and fixed-based SF assignment methods and can play a vital role in enhancing the packet delivery ratio.

~

\textbackslash{}citet\{abeele\_scalability\_2017\} studied the capacity and scalability of LoRaWAN for thousands of nodes per gateway.\\
They showed the importance of considering the capture effect and interference models.\\
They proposed an error model from BER simulations to determine communication ranges and interference.\\
They also analyzed three strategies of network deployments (random SF allocation,\\
a fixed one,\\
and according to related PDR),\\
the last one presenting the best performance.

~

\textbackslash{}citet\{abeele\_scalability\_2017\} using a LoRa ns-3 module,\\
perform a scalability analysis of LoRaWAN.\\
Their work shows detrimental impact of the downstream traffic on the delivery ratio of the upstream traffic.\\
They,\\
also,\\
show that increasing gateway density can ameliorate but not eliminate this effect,\\
as stringent duty cycle requirements for gateways continue to limit downstream opportunities.\\
The same authors show through simulations that LoRaWAN can send six times more traffic compared to pure Aloha in a single-cell LoRaWAN network for the same number of end devices per gateway when the 125-kHz channel bandwidth is used \textbackslash{}cite\{jetmir\_haxhibeqiri\_lora\_2017\}.

~

\textbackslash{}citet\{abeele\_scalability\_2017\} analyzed the scalability of large-scale LoRaWAN using the NS-3 simulator.\\
LoRa MAC has been modeled as a pure ALOHA network that does not consider the capture effect or interference characteristics.\\
Instead,\\
the authors generated a LoRa error model from a preliminary simulation that measured the bit error rate on the baseband and used it as an interference model in the simulator.\\
The simulation result shows that the packet reception ratio varies depending on how SF values are assigned when nodes are deployed.\\
Performance is very poor when all nodes have the same SF.\\
Assigning SF values randomly results in better performance than the fixed SF assignment,\\
but it is still low:\\
only a 20\textbackslash\% ratio with 5000 nodes.\\
They improved the performance by about two times compared with the random assignment method by using a PER (packet error rate) strategy that assigns the minimum SF value at which the PER falls below a certain threshold.\\
The authors ran another experiment that set the size of an application payload to 8 bytes and used a single channel.\\
In this experiment,\\
they increased the data period from 600 s to 60,000 s,\\
varied the number of gateways from 1 to 4,\\
and then evaluated MAC performance.\\
Their results confirm that the PDR increases exponentially as the data period increases.\\
With respect to the gateways,\\
the PDR achieves 70\textbackslash\%, 89\textbackslash\%,\\
and 96\textbackslash\% when 1, 2,\\
and 4 gateways are deployed in an area with 10,000 nodes that send data every 600 s.\\
This illustrates the possibility of using multiple gateways to improve LoRa performance in a dense environment.\\
Our experiments used the LBT scheme on multiple channels,\\
so it is impossible to compare our results to theirs directly.\\
However,\\
both results indicate that there is a trade-off between the number of nodes and the data period to achieve a given level of LoRa MAC performance.

~

In \textbackslash{}cite\{abeele\_scalability\_2017\},\\
system-level simulations are again employed to assess the performance of confirmed and unconfirmed messages and show the detrimental impact of confirmation traffic on the overall network capacity and throughput.\\
Here,\\
the only proposed solution is the use of multiple gateways,\\
without deeply investigating the specificities of the LoRaWAN standard.

~

~

\textbackslash{}citet\{abeele\_scalability\_2017\} presented a LoRa simulator based on ns-3.\\
The work characterizes the scalability in scenarios with both uplink and downlink transmissions;\\
however,\\
it does not consider dynamic configuration of transmission parameters.

  abstract = {The quick proliferation of LPWAN networks, being LoRaWAN one of the most adopted, raised the interest of the industry, network operators and facilitated the development of novel services based on large scale and simple network structures. LoRaWAN brings the desired ubiquitous connectivity to enable most of the outdoor IoT applications and its growth and quick adoption are real proofs of that. Yet the technology has some limitations that need to be understood in order to avoid over-use of the technology. In this article we aim to provide an impartial overview of what are the limitations of such technology, and in a comprehensive manner bring use case examples to show where the limits are.},
  annotation = {In \textbackslash{}cite\{adelantado\_understanding\_2017\},\\
the authors focus on the performance impact of LoRa on higher layers.\\
otably from their work is that the down-link receive window is seen as the limiting factor.\\
This work,\\
like the others,\\
identifies that the main scalability limit of LoRa is its channel access protocol (essentially ALOHA) together with its rather expensive packet acknowledgements.

\textbackslash{}citet\{adelantado\_understanding\_2017\} also calculate LoRaWAN capacity as the superposition of independent ALOHA-based networks (one for each channel and for each SF).\\
In conclusion,\\
analyses based on pure ALOHA,\\
fail to adequately model interference in LoRaWAN networks and therefor underestimate the capacity of LoRaWAN LPWANs.

~

\textbackslash{}citet\{adelantado\_understanding\_2017\} referred to the duty-cycle constraint as a major factor limiting LoRa MAC performance.\\
A higher SF value allows a wider communication range but also increases the ToA,\\
which inevitably leads to an increase in the off-period duration under the constraint.\\
The problem can be serious because,\\
generally,\\
nodes using high SF values are much more numerous than nodes using low SF values.\\
The study applied 3 channels and a 1\textbackslash\% duty cycle as the fixed parameters and simulated\\
the packet reception ratio for a given packet length and number of nodes.\\
As a result,\\
although the packet length is small at 10 bytes,\\
the packet reception rate decreases exponentially because of the increasing number of collisions as the number of nodes increases.\\
Notably,\\
it converges to almost zero when more than 1500 nodes are deployed.\\
On the contrary,\\
a small number of nodes decreases the probability of collision,\\
but the throughput is limited by the duty cycle.

~

In \textbackslash{}cite\{adelantado\_understanding\_2017\},\\
some interesting insights on the limits of LoRaWAN R are given,\\
but again the model is based on Poisson process and there is no possible extension to account for the capture effect.\\
In this article,\\
in order to give the limit of the performance,\\
we study the outage probability and throughput of LoRaWAN R and Sigfox R when every node is transmitting as frequently as possible,\\
according to either the ISM band duty cycle constraints or technology-related constraints,\\
which result in message sending periods in the order of 1 to 10 minutes.\\
This scenario of the saturation throughput could be that of packet and object tracking systems [The internet of things:\\
a survey.\\
Information Systems Frontiers].\\
Other less frequent IoT scenarios such as water \textbackslash\& gas metering can be evaluated using our model thanks to its flexibility.

~

As \textbackslash{}citet\{adelantado\_understanding\_2017\} state,\\
the throughput of the network is upper-bound either by the collision rate (lower DR,\\
shorter TOA) or by the duty-cycle limitation (higher DR,\\
longer TOA).\\
The systems containing end-nodes whose transmission parameters are constant with respect to time are particularly affected.

~

\textbackslash{}citet\{adelantado\_understanding\_2017\} showed that an excessive number of nodes (28 \textbackslash\% of the network) should use the largest SF\\
(SF12) to ensure the coverage of urban cells.\\
This approach only considered the path loss and ignored the airtime when using SF12.

~

On the contrary,\\
although LoRaWAN is rising with a promising future,\\
\textbackslash{}citet\{adelantado\_understanding\_2017\} give an objective description of limitations of LoRaWAN in accordance with the development questions in research and application.

~

\textbackslash{}citet\{adelantado\_understanding\_2017\} explored LoRa from the point of view of the capacity and the network size.\\
They observed that for low duty cycles,\\
throughput is limited by collisions,\\
whereas for higher duty cycle values,\\
the maximum duty cycle set by the ETSI regulations prevents devices from increasing their packet transmission rates and limits throughput.\\
For instance,\\
for 1000 devices,\\
the maximum packet rate per node is 38 pkt/hour (packets of 50 B) with the probability of successful reception of only 13\textbackslash\%.

~

\textbackslash{}citet\{adelantado\_understanding\_2017\} detailed the characteristics and limits of LoRa/LoRaWAN in terms of the relationships between duty cycle and throughput with various packet sizes.\\
Duty cycle defines the ratio of the time that a device can transmit data,\\
in order to regulate signal transmission and avoid signal collisions.\\
They described how LoRa can be used in real-time monitoring,\\
metering,\\
smart transportation and logistics,\\
but not for video surveillance.

Smart devices are composed of several components including sensors, boards, batteries, processing units, and antennas. However, the form and size of the smart devices are usually limited due to antenna restrictions. In this paper, we propose the architecture of a compact low-cost LoRa smart device designed for easy deployment in smart building applications. The proposed device architecture features a reduced size embedded antenna and an ultra-low-power microcontroller to interface several sensors and actuators. The results obtained have shown that the proposed design can be used for communication, between two compact LoRa devices, in line-of-sight for up to 4.2 km, in urban environments for up to 1.2 km and also for in-building communications for up to 152 m, without compromising the low-power features that LoRa supports.},

  abstract = {The vision of next generation 5G wireless communications lies in providing very high data rates (typically of Gbps order), extremely low latency, manifold increase in base station capacity, and significant improvement in users' perceived quality of service (QoS), compared to current 4G LTE networks. Ever increasing proliferation of smart devices, introduction of new emerging multimedia applications, together with an exponential rise in wireless data (multimedia) demand and usage is already creating a significant burden on existing cellular networks. 5G wireless systems, with improved data rates, capacity, latency, and QoS are expected to be the panacea of most of the current cellular networks' problems. In this survey, we make an exhaustive review of wireless evolution toward 5G networks. We first discuss the new architectural changes associated with the radio access network (RAN) design, including air interfaces, smart antennas, cloud and heterogeneous RAN. Subsequently, we make an in-depth survey of underlying novel mm-wave physical layer technologies, encompassing new channel model estimation, directional antenna design, beamforming algorithms, and massive MIMO technologies. Next, the details of MAC layer protocols and multiplexing schemes needed to efficiently support this new physical layer are discussed. We also look into the killer applications, considered as the major driving force behind 5G. In order to understand the improved user experience, we provide highlights of new QoS, QoE, and SON features associated with the 5G evolution. For alleviating the increased network energy consumption and operating expenditure, we make a detail review on energy awareness and cost efficiency. As understanding the current status of 5G implementation is important for its eventual commercialization, we also discuss relevant field trials, drive tests, and simulation experiments. Finally, we point out major existing research issues and identify possible future research directions.},

Therefore, network slicing will provide the required design flexibility. Radio resource slicing would be an indispensable component of any network slicing solution. This paper proposes Hap-SliceR, which is a novel radio resource slicing framework for 5G networks with haptic communications. First, Hap-SliceR derives a network-wide radio resource slicing strategy for 5G networks. The optimal slicing strategy, which is based on a reinforcement learning approach, allocates radio resources to different slices while accounting for the dynamics and utility requirements of different slices. Second, Hap-SliceR provides customization of radio resources for haptic communications over 5G networks. The radio resource allocation requirements of haptic communications have been translated into a unique radio resource allocation problem. A low-complexity heuristic algorithm has been developed for resource allocation. Finally, a comprehensive performance evaluation of Hap-SliceR has been conducted based on a recently proposed 5G air-interface design.},

In general, two main categories of networks are used in the IoT: short-range and long-range low-power networks. IPv6 over low-power wireless personal area networks (6LoWPAN) are considered to be a crucial network in short-range low-power networks where 6LoWPAN motes will account for the majority of short-range low-power things. Also, LoRaWAN and SigFox are two major networking landscapes and players in long-range, low-power networks or oftentimes called low-power wide area networks (LPWAN). This paper reviews and compares 6LoWPAN and LPWAN in terms of network architecture, protocol stack, applications and security. In general, LPWAN networks are more demanding in terms of node and link constraints than 6LoWPAN networks (e.g. very low payload size, very low data rate and very limited resources). Also, as yet, LPWAN networks do not have IPv6 addressing capabilities. Each network category has its unique characteristics and strengths and each category has its important role in the IoT world.},

  abstract = {Recently, the increasing demand for low latency, the explosive growth in the volume of network traffic, the large and growing number of connected devices, and diversified multimedia applications have paved the way for a new era of mobile networks. To meet these diverse requirements of different businesses in network virtualization, network slicing has emerged as a promising paradigm of upcoming 5G mobile networks. Network slicing is a major technology, based on network function virtualization and software defined network technologies, which aims to achieve more efficient utilization of available network traffic and reduce operating costs. In this paper, we propose a network slicing architecture for 5G mobile networks involving cloud radio access network (C-RAN), mobile edge computing (MEC), and cloud data center. We model the proposed network slicing system based on queueing theory, which can be used to derive the main performance metrics such as the CPU utilization, system throughput, system drop rate, average number of message requests, average response time, and average waiting time. We provide quantitative examples to show how this proposed model could be applied to estimate the system performance and cost for a network slicing system in 5G mobile networks and the number of C-RAN and MEC cores required under diverse 5G traffic conditions. The analytical results and simulation models indicate that the proposed model has a powerful ability to assign the number of C-RAN and MEC cores required to achieve the quality of service targets of 5G slices.},

  abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) devices can be equipped with multiple heterogeneous network interfaces. An overwhelmingly large amount of services may demand some or all of these interfaces' available resources. Herein, we present a precise mathematical formulation of assigning services to interfaces with heterogeneous resources in one or more rounds. For reasonable instance sizes, the presented formulation produces optimal solutions for this computationally hard problem. We prove the NP-Completeness of the problem and develop two algorithms to approximate the optimal solution for big instance sizes. The first algorithm allocates the most demanding service requirements first, considering the average cost of interfaces resources. The second one calculates the demanding resource shares and allocates the most demanding of them first by choosing randomly among equally demanding shares. Finally, we provide simulation results giving insight into services splitting over different interfaces for both cases.},

The physical and data link layer performance are evaluated by field tests and simulations.\\
Based on the analysis and evaluations,\\
the authors show that LoRa physical layer,\\
thanks to the chirp spread spectrum modulation and high receiver sensitivity,\\
offers good resistance to interference.\\
Field tests show that LoRa can offer satisfactory network coverage up to 3 km in a suburban area with dense residential dwellings.\\
The SF has significant impact on the network coverage,\\
as does the data rate.

~

A second,\\
but similarly lacking,\\
pure ALOHA capacity analysis of LoRaWAN is discussed in \textbackslash{}cite\{augustin\_study\_2016\}.

~

\textbackslash{}citet\{augustin\_study\_2016\} reported the result of suburban experiments in Paris.\\
Cisco 910 as a gateway was installed outside a residential window at a height of about 5 meters.\\
LoRa nodes were placed in 5 different locations so that their distances from the gateway were 600 m, 1400 m, 2300 m, 2800 m,\\
and 3400 m.\\
There were 3 options for SF values: 7, 9,\\
and 12.\\
The adaptive data rate and retransmission were not used.\\
Experimental results show that the PDR is about 90\textbackslash\% when SF 12 is used at 2800 m,\\
and the ratio drops to less than 10\textbackslash\% at SF 9.\\
At 3400 m,\\
only about 40\textbackslash\% of the received packets have SF 12.

\textbackslash{}citet\{augustin\_study\_2016\} presented throughput measurements on a testbed showing:\\
i) less than 10\textbackslash\% of loss rate over a distance\\
of 2 km for SF 9-12 and ii) more than 60\textbackslash\% of loss rate over\\
3.4 km for SF 12.\\
They also simulated the LoRa behavior for a larger number of devices and showed that it behaves closely to ALOHA with the maximum channel capacity of 18\textbackslash\% and\\
an increasing collision ratio:\\
for a link load of 0.48,\\
the ratio is around 60\textbackslash\%.

~

As mentioned by \textbackslash{}citet\{augustin\_study\_2016\},\\
the packet payload is up to 255 bytes with a low duty cycle limit.\\
Their study led to a number of open research challenges,\\
particularly in channel management,\\
such as time division multiple access over LoRaWAN and random-based access in unlicensed bands.\\
To design and improve LoRa network performance,\\
understanding network-related dependencies is essential.

~

\textbackslash{}citet\{augustin\_study\_2016\} also studied network-related parameters for performance improvements and also measured network sensitivity and coverage.\\
Our study proposed an appropriate strategy on gateway placement based on signal intensity and sensitivity in the context of three building density environments in Brisbane,\\
Australia.

These types of technologies provide the Internet of Things (IoT) devices with the ability to transmit few bytes of data for long ranges, taking into consideration minimum power consumption. In parallel, IoT applications will cover a wide range of human and life needs from smart environments (cities, home, transportation etc.) to health and quality of life. Among these popular LPWANs technologies, we have identified the unlicensed frequency band (LoRa, DASH7, SigFox, Wi-SUN, etc.), and the licensed frequency band standards (NB-IoT, LTE Cat-M, EC-GSM-IoT, etc.). In general, both types of standards only consider fixed interconnected things, and less attention has been provided to the mobility of the things or devices. In this paper, we address the mobility of the things and the connectivity in each of the three LPWAN standards: LoRaWAN, DASH7, and NB-IoT. In particular, we show how the mobility of things can be achieved when transmitting and receiving data. Then, we provide a general and technical comparison for the three standards. Finally, we illustrate several application scenarios where the mobility is required, and we show how to select the most suited standard. We also discuss the research challenges and perspectives.},

A mathematical model of the access mechanism to the communication channel is presented in \textbackslash{}cite\{bankov\_mathematical\_2017\}.\\
A certain threshold of the network load is also calculated in this paper by estimating the throughput.\\
When this threshold value is reached,\\
the PER (Packet Error Rate) parameter increases rapidly towards 1,\\

  abstract = {Contemporary multimedia consumer devices are increasingly obtaining network connectivity mostly through wireless means. In order to economically support the mobile lifestyle of users, a new class of multimodal consumer devices has emerged that are equipped with heterogeneous wireless access capability. Inter-working of heterogeneous packet switched wireless networks, e.g., cellular and WLANs, via IP is a key step to provide ubiquitous service delivery via seamless connectivity of consumer devices. These wireless networks have a diverse range of capabilities and therefore selection of a specific network to optimize service delivery is an issue. Various algorithms have been proposed for use in the decision making process, with the class of Multi Attribute Decision Making (MADM) methods being one of the most promising. MADM methods, however, are known to suffer from ranking abnormalities. This paper applies TOPSIS, a MADM algorithm, to the problem of network selection. The causes of ranking abnormalities in TOPSIS are analyzed. An improvement to the algorithm as applied to the problem of network selection, where only the top ranking alternatives are considered important for decision making, is proposed. The new approach iteratively applies TOPSIS to the problem, removing the bottom ranked candidate network after each iteration. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed iterative TOPSIS approach.},

Most cities experiencing these difficulties can, therefore, use stand-alone LoRaWAN base station solutions and provide good coverage of the area. Leftovers can claim to have access to acceptable connectivity, and therefore cheaper wireless communication, giving direct access to Internet from the collection node, will be required for data transmission: Wi-Fi can attain these objectives. In this article, we first examine the existing tools to ensure a good coverage study of the LoRaWAN network and, thus, perform a testBed. After, we offer a multi-optional architectural model that supports LoRaWAN and Wi-Fi protocols and that is flexible for other options. A gateway (Wi-IoT) capable of both providing Wi-Fi access and at the same time the ability to collect, process and monitor data as a mini-server will be proposed as proof of concept. From the node to the gateway, the data is compressed and sent securely and a user who connects to the gateway can, then, have access to the data.},

  abstract = {We are on the entry of the exponential advancement of the internet-of-things (IoT) due to the quick development of internetconnected smart-objects. As the number of connected smart-objects increase, IoT will continue to advance by providing connectivity and interactions between the physical and the cyber world. This connectivity is characterized by low throughput, delay sensitivity, small and wide coverage, low power consumption, low device, etc. Which explains the emergence of low power wide area network (LPWAN). LPWAN technologies are an alternative promising connectivity solutions for Internet of Things. However, the lack of an overall LPWAN knowledge that present a comprehensive analysis of LPWAN technologies is presently constraining the achievement of the modern IoT vision. In this paper, we begin with a detailed analysis of the conventional high power long-range network technologies that considers IoT applications and requirements. We further point out the need for dedicated low power wide area technologies in IoT systems. In addition, we analyse the technical specification based on the PHY and MAC layers of the technologies that are already deployed, or likely to be deployed. The focus is to incorporate both standard and proprietary technologies in our study. Furthermore, we present the modelling techniques and performance metrics that are adopted in LPWAN networks analysis. Finally, challenges and open problems are presented. The main contribution of this study is that it provides an enhanced summary of the current state-of-the-art of LPWAN suitable to meet the requirements of IoT, while uniquely providing LPWAN's modelling techniques, performance metrics and their associated enablers.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a content delivery network as a service (CDNaaS) platform that allows dynamic deployment and life-cycle management of virtual content delivery network (CDN) slices running across multiple administrative cloud domains. The CDN slice consists of four virtual network function (VNF) types, namely virtual transcoders, virtual streamers, virtual caches, and a CDN-slice-specific Coordinator for the management of the slice resources across the involved cloud domains. To create an efficient CDN slice, the optimal placement of its composing VNFs using adequate amount of virtual resources for each VNF is of vital importance. In this vein, this paper devises mechanisms for allocating an appropriate set of VNFs for each CDN slice to meet its performance requirements and minimize as much as possible the incurred cost in terms of allocated virtual resources. A mathematical model is developed to evaluate the performance of the proposed mechanisms. We first formulate the VNF placement problem as two Linear Integer problem models, aiming at minimizing the cost and maximizing the quality of experience (QoE) of the virtual streaming service. By applying the bargaining game theory, we ensure an optimal tradeoff solution between the cost efficiency and QoE. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed models in achieving their design objectives and encouraging results are obtained.},

We assume a space-time Poisson model of packets transmitted by LoRA nodes to a fixed base station. Following previous studies of the impact of interference [8, 10], we assume that a given packet is successfully received when no interfering packet arrives with similar power before the given packet payload phase. This is as a consequence of LoRa using different transmission rates for different link budgets (transmissions with smaller received powers use larger spreading factors) and LoRa intra-technology interference treatment. Using our model, we study the scaling of the packet reception probabilities per link budget as a function of the spatial density of nodes and their rate of transmissions. We consider both the parameter values recommended by the LoRa provider, as well as proposing LoRa tuning to improve the equality of performance for all link budgets. We also consider spatially non-homogeneous distributions of LoRa nodes. We show also how a fair comparison to non-slotted Aloha can be made within the same framework.},

  abstract = {New Internet of Things (IoT) technologies such as Long Range (LoRa) are emerging which enable power efficient wireless communication over very long distances. Devices typically communicate directly to a sink node which removes the need of constructing and maintaining a complex multihop network. Given the fact that a wide area is covered and that all devices communicate directly to a few sink nodes a large number of nodes have to share the communication medium. LoRa provides for this reason a range of communication options (centre frequency, spreading factor, bandwidth, coding rates) from which a transmitter can choose. Many combination settings are orthogonal and provide simultaneous collision free communications. Nevertheless, there is a limit regarding the number of transmitters a LoRa system can support. In this paper we investigate the capacity limits of LoRa networks. Using experiments we develop models describing LoRa communication behaviour. We use these models to parameterise a LoRa simulation to study scalability. Our experiments show that a typical smart city deployment can support 120 nodes per 3.8 ha, which is not sufficient for future IoT deployments. LoRa networks can scale quite well, however, if they use dynamic communication parameter selection and/or multiple sinks.},

  abstract = {New transceiver technologies have emerged which enable power efficient communication over very long distances. Examples of such Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) technologies are LoRa, Sigfox and Weightless. A typical application scenario for these technologies is city wide meter reading collection where devices send readings at very low frequency over a long distance to a data concentrator (one-hop networks). We argue that these transceivers are potentially very useful to construct more generic Internet of Things (IoT) networks incorporating multi-hop bidirectional communication enabling sensing and actuation. Furthermore, these transceivers have interesting features not available with more traditional transceivers used for IoT networks which enable construction of novel protocol elements. In this paper we present a performance and capability analysis of a currently available LoRa transceiver. We describe its features and then demonstrate how such transceiver can be put to use efficiently in a wide-area application scenario. In particular we demonstrate how unique features such as concurrent non-destructive transmissions and carrier detection can be employed. Our deployment experiment demonstrates that 6 LoRa nodes can form a network covering 1.5 ha in a built up environment, achieving a potential lifetime of 2 year on 2 AA batteries and delivering data within 5 s and reliability of 80\%.},

vendors offering NM on the market keep their algorithms as a part of the intellectual property.\\
Contrary to this trend,\\
the general customer availability of LoRaWANTM products catalyzed the creation of several open source NM implementation projects which include the globally recognized The Things Network (TTN) and a younger LoRa Server whose ADR algorithms are publicly available [thethingsnetwork.org/wiki/LoRaWAN/ADR].\\

  abstract = {Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) technologies such as Long Range (LoRa) are emerging that enable power efficient wireless communication over very long distances. LPWAN devices typically communicate directly to a sink node which removes the need of constructing and maintaining a complex multi-hop network. However, to ensure efficient and reliable communication LPWAN devices often provide a large number of transmission parameters. For example, a LoRa device can be configured to use different spreading factors, bandwidth settings, coding rates and transmission powers, resulting in over 6720 possible settings. It is a challenge to determine the setting that minimises transmission energy cost while meeting the required communication performance. This paper is the first to present a thorough analysis of the impact of LoRa transmission parameter selection on communication performance. We study in detail the impact of parameter settings on energy consumption and communication reliability. Using this study we develop a link probing regime which enables us to quickly determine transmission settings that satisfy performance requirements. The presented work is a first step towards an automated mechanism for LoRa transmission parameter selection that a deployed LoRa network requires, but is not yet specified within the Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) framework.},
  annotation = {\textbackslash{}citet\{bor\_lora\_2017\} presented a capability and performance analysis of a LoRa transceiver and proposed LoRaBlink protocol for link-level parameter adaptation.

\textbackslash{}citet\{bor\_lora\_2016\} studied LoRa transceiver capabilities and the limit supported by LoRa system.\\
They showed that LoRa networks can scale if they use dynamic selection of transmission parameters.

For instance,\\
\textbackslash{}cite\{bor\_lora\_2017\} introduces an algorithm for selecting proper parameters considering a desired energy consumption and link quality.\\
In [LoRa from the city to the mountains:\\
Exploration of hardware and environmental factors],\\
a measurement study shows that vegetation has a big impact on LoRa transmissions.\\
The Spreading Factor (SF) and the transmission data rate have a significant impact on the network coverage according to \textbackslash{}cite\{augustin\_study\_2016\}.

~

For example,\\
in \textbackslash{}cite\{bor\_lora\_2017\},\\
a transmission parameter selection algorithm for LoRa is presented with a goal to minimize energy consumption at a specific reliability level.\\
To enable LoRaWAN to achieve a high data rate two different spreading factor allocations algorithms are presented in \textbackslash{}cite\{cuomo\_explora\_2017\}.

~

\textbackslash{}citet\{bor\_lora\_2017\} identified more than 6000 various parameter combinations for LoRa networks and developed an algorithm for automatic selection on LoRa transmission parameters.\\
The performance measurements on our LoRa network also were related to some of their parameter selections.

~

\textbackslash{}citet\{bor\_lora\_nodate\} also propose LoRaBlink,\\
a MAC and routing cross-layer scheme,\\
above the LoRa physical layer to extend the radio coverage of the gateway.\\
LoRaBlink is self-organized network based on beacons (that contains distance in hops from the sink) and time-slotted channel access method.\\
Their performance evaluation show that LoRaBlink may cover a network of 1.5 ha in a built up environment,\\
achieve 80\textbackslash\% of\\
reliability while having a potential lifetime of 2 years.

\textbackslash{}citet\{bor\_lora\_nodate\} conducted experiments using multiple nodes transmitting data using LoRa.\\
Experiments were conducted in which two devices sent packets at different power levels,\\
but the same spreading factor,\\
to estimate the influence of concurrent transmissions.\\
Additionally,\\
a new media access control (MAC),\\
LoRaBlink,\\
was developed to enable direct connection of nodes without using LoRaWAN.\\
Contrary to the above-mentioned work,\\
we have not confined to a single base-station,\\
but we have provided extensive measurements based on the large-scale ``The Things Networks'' network and for a duration of 8 months.

~

Similarly,\\
a probing algorithm using trial and error method for selecting the optimal settings is illustrated in \textbackslash{}cite\{bor\_lora\_2017\} These described methods converge to an optimal setting step by step after multiple transmissions for the fixed distance between the node and the gateways.\\
However,\\
such methods become unsuitable in moving node scenarios.\\
The research involving LoRa moving nodes include several works.

~

\textbackslash{}citet\{bor\_lora\_2017\} explore LoRa configuration parameters such as SF,\\
bandwidth,\\
coding rate and transmission power,\\
which result in 6, 720 possible settings,\\
and proposes an optimization problem that minimizes energy spent on data transmission while meeting required communication performance.

\textbackslash{}citet\{bor\_lora\_nodate\} analyzed the access mechanism of the communication channel.\\
From the obtained results,\\
it can be seen that when the same SF (spreading factor) is used,\\
by both the receiver and the transmitter,\\
the packets are received even if a third node attempts to interfere with the transmission.\\
Thus,\\
the separation of channels by using different SF proves effective.\\
One or two simultaneous transmissions can be received with high probability,\\
if there is a separation of at least 3 symbol periods between them.\\
The paper also analyzes the possibility of implementing a carrier activity detection mechanism.\\
An algorithm for the automatic selection of communication parameters is presented in \textbackslash{}cite\{bor\_lora\_2017\} so as to achieve a performance level as high as possible,\\
at the same time ensuring energy efficiency.

~

Other works,\\
such as \textbackslash{}cite\{bor\_lora\_2017\},\\
examine the impact of the modulation parameters on the single communication link between an ED and its GW,\\
without considering more complex network configurations.\\
2 Note that,\\
from the GW perspective,\\
ACK packets are not distinguishable from any other DL packet and,\\
hence,\\
are subject to the same rules and constraints.

~

In addition,\\
the authors in \textbackslash{}cite\{bor\_lora\_2017\} propose an link probing regime to select transmission parameters in order to achieve lower energy consumption.

~

In \textbackslash{}cite\{bor\_lora\_2017\} the authors studied the impact of LoRa parameter settings (bandwith,\\
coding rate,\\
spreading factor,\\
transmission power,\\
etc.) on energy consumption and communication reliability.\\
They proposed a mechanism to automatically select LoRa transmission parameters that satisfy the performance requirements.\\
This solution is optimal for a given application scenario,\\
but it is not convenient when traffic dynamically changes.

  abstract = {Energy efficiency is the key requirement to maximize sensor node lifetime. Sensor nodes are typically powered by a battery source that has finite lifetime. Most Internet of Thing (IoT) applications require sensor nodes to operate reliably for an extended period of time. To design an autonomous sensor node, it is important to model its energy consumption for different tasks. Each task consumes a power consumption amount for a period of time. To optimize the consumed energy of the sensor node and have long communication range, Low Power Wide Area Network technology is considered. This paper describes an energy consumption model based on LoRa and LoRaWAN, which allows estimating the consumed power of each sensor node element. The definition of the different node units is first introduced. Then, a full energy model for communicating sensors is proposed. This model can be used to compare different LoRaWAN modes to find the best sensor node design to achieve its energy autonomy.},

  abstract = {The forecast dramatic growth, of the number of Machine-toMachine (M2M) communications, challenges the traditional networks of Mobile Network Operators (MNO). In fact, a large number of devices may attempt simultaneously to access the base station, which may result in severe congestions at the random-access channel (RACH) level. To alleviate such congestion while regulating the M2M devices' opportunities to transmit, the Access Class Barring (ACB) process was proposed. In this article, we propose a novel implementation of the ACB mechanism in the context of multiple M2M traffic classes. Based on a scheduling algorithm, we have applied a PID controller to adjust dynamically multiple ACB factors related to each class category, guaranteeing a number of devices around an optimal value that maximizes the Random Access (RA) success probability. The obtained results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed mechanism by increasing the success probability and minimizing radio resources' underutilization with respect to each class priority.},

With network slicing, service providers can provide a cost-efficient solution towards meeting diverse performance requirements of deployed applications and services. Despite slicing benefits, End-to-End orchestration and management of network slices is a challenging and complicated task. In this chapter, we intend to survey all the relevant aspects of network slicing, with the focus on networking technologies such as Software-defined networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) in 5G, Fog/Edge and Cloud Computing platforms. To build the required background, this chapter begins with a brief overview of 5G, Fog/Edge and Cloud computing, and their interplay. Then we cover the 5G vision for network slicing and extend it to the Fog and Cloud computing through surveying the state-of-the-art slicing approaches in these platforms. We conclude the chapter by discussing future directions, analyzing gaps and trends towards the network slicing realization.},

We consider a criterion for dynamic resource allocation amongst tenants, based on a weighted proportionally fair objective, which achieves desirable fairness/protection across the network slices of the different tenants and their associated users. Several key properties are established, including: the Pareto-optimality of user association to base stations, the fair allocation of base stations' resources, and the gains resulting from dynamic resource sharing across slices, both in terms of utility gains and capacity savings. We then address algorithmic and practical challenges in realizing the proposed criterion. We show that the objective is NP-hard, making an exact solution impractical, and design a distributed semi-online algorithm, which meets performance guarantees in equilibrium and can be shown to quickly converge to a region around the equilibrium point. Building on this algorithm, we devise a practical approach with limited computational information and handoff overheads. We use detailed simulations to show that our approach is indeed near-optimal and provides substantial gains both to tenants (in terms of capacity savings) and end users (in terms of improved performance).},

Therefore, a cross-layer design is imperative to effectively realize Low Power Wide Area networks (LPWANs). In the present paper, a cross-layer assessment framework including power modeling is proposed. Through this simulation framework, the energy consumption of IoT devices, currently deployed in LoRaWAN networks, is evaluated. We demonstrate that a cross-layer approach significantly improves energy efficiency and overall throughput. Two major contributions are made. First, an opensource LPWAN assessment framework has been conceived. It allows testing and evaluating hypotheses and schemes. Secondly, as a representative case, the LoRaWAN protocol is assessed. The findings indicate how a cross-layer approach can optimize LPWANs in terms of energy efficiency and throughput. For instance, it is shown that the use of larger payloads can reduce up to three times the energy consumption on quasi-static channels yet may bring an energy penalty under adverse dynamic conditions.},

The proposed model, furthermore, makes it possible to study the effect of different parameters configurations, thus offering a valid tool to investigate possible improvements to the system configuration.

  abstract = {LoRaWAN is a flagship Low-Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technology that has highly attracted much attention from the community in recent years. Many LoRaWAN end-devices, such as sensors or actuators, are expected not to be powered by the electricity grid; therefore, it is crucial to investigate the energy consumption of LoRaWAN. However, published works have only focused on this topic to a limited extent. In this paper, we present analytical models that allow the characterization of LoRaWAN end-device current consumption, lifetime and energy cost of data delivery. The models, which have been derived based on measurements on a currently prevalent LoRaWAN hardware platform, allow us to quantify the impact of relevant physical and Medium Access Control (MAC) layer LoRaWAN parameters and mechanisms, as well as Bit Error Rate (BER) and collisions, on energy performance. Among others, evaluation results show that an appropriately configured LoRaWAN end-device platform powered by a battery of 2400 mAh can achieve a 1-year lifetime while sending one message every 5 min, and an asymptotic theoretical lifetime of 6 years for infrequent communication.},
  annotation = {\textbackslash{}citet\{casals\_modeling\_2017\} developed current models that allow the characterization of LoRaWAN devices lifetime and energy cost.\\
The proposed models were very important and derived from measurement results using a currently prevalent LoRaWAN platform.

~

However,\\
\textbackslash{}citet\{casals\_modeling\_2017\} did not include the energy consumption of the processing and the sensor units.\\
In our paper,\\
we have modeled these units for an application scenario of connected sensor.\\
Another major difference is that we have illustrated our energy model with optimization of LoRaWAN parameters such as the spreading factor SF,\\
the coding rate CR,\\
the bandwidth BW,\\
the payload size and the communication range.\\
Optimizing these parameters is very important to reduce the energy consumption of the sensor node.\\
The previous works were proposed to estimate the amount of energy consumption by a sensor node.\\
Some of these studies have not included LoRa technology into their energy models,\\
so they used different RF transceivers which are mainly dedicated to short range communication.\\
Other works did not study the energy optimization of sensor nodes.\\
In fact,\\
optimizing LoRa and LoRaWAN parameters are very interesting to reduce the energy consumption by the communicating sensor.

Unlike core network slicing, radio access network (RAN) slicing is still at its infancy, with several works just starting to investigate the challenges and potentials to enable a mutli-tenant, multi-service RAN. One of the major challenges in RAN slicing is to provide different levels of resource isolation, through resource abstraction, virtualization, and splitting among different tenants/services, while at the same time providing multiplexing gains. To this end, in this work we propose a detailed approach for radio resource virtualization, leveraging different resource abstraction types. Based on it, we formulate the problem of inter-slice resource partitioning and allocation, and propose an algorithm to efficiently tackle this problem. Finally, we provide simulation results that support the benefits of resource abstraction and our proposed algorithm.},

  abstract = {Network slicing is one key enabler to provide the required flexibility and to realize the service-oriented 5G vision. Unlike the core network slicing, radio access network (RAN) slicing is still at its infancy and several works just start to investigate the challenges and potentials to enable the multi-service RAN, toward a serviced-oriented RAN (SO-RAN) architecture. One of the major concerns in RAN slicing is to provide different levels of isolation and sharing as per slice requirement. Moreover, both control and user plane processing may be customized allowing a slice owner to flexibly control its service. Enabling dynamic RAN composition with flexible functional split for disaggregated RAN deployments is another challenge. In this paper, we propose a RAN runtime slicing system through which the operation and behavior of the underlying RAN could be customized and controlled to meet slice requirements. We present a proof-ofconcept prototype of the proposed RAN runtime slicing system for LTE, assess its feasibility and potentials, and demonstrate the isolation, sharing, and customization capabilities with three representative use cases.},

Existing approaches transmit an image in a sequence of packets each of which is individually acknowledged. This approach results in a long image transmission time due to the time spent waiting for the many individual acknowledgements. The acknowledgement traffic also inflates network load. To facilitate LoRa-based image transmission in agricultural monitoring IoT systems, this paper proposes a new reliable delivery protocol, Multi-Packet LoRa (MPLR), for transmission of large messages, such as images, in LoRa networks.

A promising technology to achieve the low-power and long-range requirements is seen in LoRaWAN, a media access control (MAC) protocol maintained by the LoRa Alliance and leveraging Semtech's patented LoRa radio modulation technology. LoRaWAN provides three different device classes (A, B and C), which provide a tradeoff between performance (i.e., throughput and latency) and energy consumption. This paper offers a theoretical and experimental comparison of these classes. The objective of the quantitative experiment was twofold: to verify the published current levels of different operating modes in a LoRa chip's datasheet and to compare the battery lifetime for the LoRa class A and C modes of operation. We used a high-end current sensing circuit to gather the voltage levels and temporal variation with increasing payload sizes and spreading factors. Using the Ohmic Law, the energy drain can be calculated and compared across the different spreading factors (SF) and classes.},

LoRa technology achieves wide coverage areas, low power consumption and robustness to interference thanks to a chirp spread-spectrum modulation, in which chirps modulated with different spreading factors (SFs) are quasi-orthogonal. We focus on the performance analysis of a single receiver in presence of collisions. First, we analyze LoRa modulation numerically and show that collisions between packets modulated with different SFs can indeed cause packet loss if the interference power received is strong enough. Second, we validate such findings in experiments based on commercial devices and softwaredefined radios. Contradicting the common belief that SFs can be considered orthogonal, our results demonstrate that interSF collisions are indeed an issue in LoRa networks and, thus, allocating higher SFs to users far from the gateway might not necessarily improve their link capacity, in case of congested networks.},

  abstract = {LoRaWAN is emerging as an attractive network infrastructure for ultra low power Internet of Thing devices. Albeit the technology itself is quite mature and specified, how to effectively allocate wireless resources so as to support a large amount of devices in a same terrestrial area is an open challenge. This paper contributes by proposing two algorithms (of incremental complexity) which are shown to outperform the basic Adaptive Rate Strategy (ADR) so far considered. A first approach, named EXPLoRa-SF, shows the benefits of a simple strategy which does not limit to use (as per ADR) distance/RSSI measurements, but also selects Spreading Factors (SF) based on the total number of connected devices. The advantages attained with EXPLoRa-SF further lead us to propose a more sophisticated algorithm, named EXPLoRa-AT, which employs an innovative ``ordered waterfilling'' approach which attempts to allocate the spreading factors so as to equalize the Time on Air of the packets transmitted by the system's end devices in each spreading factor's group. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms significantly outperform the basic ADR strategy, and particularly the EXPLoRa-AT algorithm appears very robust to different operating conditions and consistently guarantees high bit rates in the case of high traffic loads.},
  annotation = {\textbackslash{}citet\{cuomo\_explora\_2017\} propose algorithms to replace LoRa WAN adaptive data rate strategy.\\
The proposed algorithms do not base the configuration of the spreading factor (SF) on distance and received power measurements,\\
but take into account the number of connected devices,\\
allowing the equalization of the time-on-air (ToA) of the packets in each SF.

\textbackslash{}citet\{cuomo\_explora\_2017\} extended the work on parallel transmission in a single-hop LoRa network.\\
Specifically,\\
these authors proposed to use the airtime to balance the nodes of each group with a specific SF and to attempt to use a high data rate to offload the traffic to less congested larger SFs.\\
However,\\
these strategies cannot be easily applied to a multi-hop LoRa network because of their lack of consideration in regards to multi-hop relays.\\
In contrast to a single hop network in which the airtime of different groups is only decided by the number of nodes and their data rates,\\
the airtime in a multi-hop network is also determined by the hop count of each subnet.\\
Moreover,\\
the connectivity between multiple relays is still not considered when conducting SF allocation in a single-hop LoRa network.\\
B.\\
SF ALLOCATION IN A MULTI-HOP NETWORK As compared to single-hop LoRa networks,\\
multi-hop networks are more flexible to extend the coverage and more efficient to improve the data transmission without increasing the number of gateways.\\
A practical strategy that transforms the topology from a star to a mesh network when the coverage range exceeds 3.2 km was proposed \textbackslash{}cite\{ochoa\_evaluating\_2017\}.

~

In \textbackslash{}cite\{cuomo\_explora\_2017\},\\
EXPLoRa-SF selects spreading factors based on the total number of connected nodes and EXPLoRa-AT equalizes the time-on-air of packets transmitted at the different spreading factors.

~

Authors in \textbackslash{}cite\{cuomo\_explora\_2017\} proposed two SF allocation approaches,\\
namely EXP-SF and EXP-AT,\\
to help LoRaWAN achieve a high overall data rate.\\
EXP-SF equally allocates SF s to N nodes based on the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI),\\
where the first N/6 nodes with the highest RSSI get SF 7 assigned and then the next N/6 nodes SF 8 and so on.\\
EXP-AT is more dynamic than EXP-SF,\\
where the SF allocation theoretically equalizes the airtime of nodes.

~

\textbackslash{}citet\{cuomo\_explora\_2017\} suggest algorithms to replace LoRa WAN adaptive data rate strategy.\\
The algorithms do not base the spreading factor (SF) configuration only on distance and received power,\\
but also take into account the number of connected devices,\\
equalizing the time-on-air (ToA) of packets in each SF.

the EXPLoRa heuristic \textbackslash{}cite\{cuomo\_explora\_2017\} aims to efficiently distribute the SFs among end-devices:\\
the EXPLoRa-SF tries to equally distribute the SFs among the total number of nodes only constrained by the Receiver Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) values.\\
A more sophisticated approach,\\
EXPLoRa-AT tries to equalize the Time-on-Air of the transmitted packets among the SF channels.\\
The solutions presented in this paper are an upgrade of the latter approach by taking into account different traffic areas as well as variable payloads and message periods,\\
thereby being able to precisely determine and equalize the traffic load for each SF channel,\\
expressed in terms of symbol time.

  abstract = {To exploit the LoRaWAN (Long-Range Wide Area Network), it is essential to design suitable allocation schemes for the wireless resources. To this aim, strategies for a fair allocation of Spreading Factors (SF) among the network devices have been presented. These strategies greatly outperform the basic Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) scheme. Within these techniques, EXPLoRa-AT yields so far the best results exploiting an ``ordered water-filling'' approach which aims to equalize the Air-Time channel usage for each group of devices using the same SF. This paper proposes two innovative schemes based on the former one, named EXPLoRaKM (K-means) and EXPLoRa-TS (Time Symbol). Both schemes exploit the ``ordered water-filling'' approach, and apply further heuristics based on network traffic knowledge. EXPLoRa-KM aims to relieve critical regions, characterized by a significant number of collisions, computing suitable adjustments on the SF allocation using K-means. Conversely, and with incremented complexity, EXPLoRa-TS performs an equalization of the traffic load (measured in symbol times) among the SF channels. The latter takes into account the fact that each device, according to its application, transmits a variable amount of data at a different sending rate. Thus, different traffic types (more or less aggressive) can be recognized. Simulation results show how both heuristics give significant performance improvements when different traffic loads are generated around a LoRaWAN Gateway. Taking into account the traffic behavior, the techniques provided in this paper contribute as promising kick-off strategies for enhancing the network performance in order to come up with the ultimate goal of scalability on a LoRaWAN network for heterogeneous IoT scenarios.},

  abstract = {Fog radio access networks (F-RANs) take full advantages of both fog and cloud computing technologies, and benefit from using network slicing to support diverse services with different quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. In this paper, to make the network slicing in F-RANs work efficiently, the radio resource allocation for different network slices is exploited in a downlink F-RAN with device-to-device communication, which is logically partitioned into a high-transmission-rate slice and a low-latency slice. A multi-objective optimization problem is presented with respect to diverse QoS demands, which can be formulated as a single-objective optimization problem with a linear weighted sum method. Then an equivalent drift-plus-penalty minimization problem with Lyapunov optimization is proposed, in which two subproblems are partitioned and solved by weighted minimum mean square error approach and Lagrange dual decomposition method, respectively. Numerical results confirm that a [O(1/V ), O(V )] utility-delay tradeoff is obtained, in which either a 34.5\% reduction in the queuing delay or a 6.5\% increase in the average weighted utility can be achieved in a specific model by choosing proper values of V .},

  abstract = {Knowing the heterogeneity of applications and services that need to to be supported in the internet of things (IoT), network slicing came out as a potential solution that virtually isolates 5G networks with various service requirements over a common physical network infrastructure. The latter needs to simultaneously support and isolate traffic issued from mobile and machine services which may require different needs in terms of reliability, latency, and bandwidth. In this paper, network slicing is investigated in LoRa networks over fixed and dynamic slicing strategies. The performance of LoRa slices is evaluated with different spreading factor (SF) configurations. Then, a dynamic inter-slicing algorithm is proposed based on a maximum likelihood estimation that avoids resource starvation and prioritizes a slice over another depending on its QoS requirements. Moreover, a novel intra-slicing strategy is proposed that maximizes resource allocation efficiency of LoRa slices with regard to their delay requirements. An energy module for LoRa in NS3 is also implemented to evaluate the energy consumption of devices in each slice. Simulation results performed in realistic LoRa scenarios highlight the utility of our proposition in improving QoS requirements of IoT devices and providing isolation between slices.},

  abstract = {Radio access network (RAN) slicing is an effective methodology to dynamically allocate networking resources in 5G networks. One of the main challenges of RAN slicing is that it is provably an NP-Hard problem. For this reason, we design near-optimal low-complexity distributed RAN slicing algorithms. First, we model the slicing problem as a congestion game, and demonstrate that such game admits a unique Nash equilibrium (NE). Then, we evaluate the Price of Anarchy (PoA) of the NE, i.e., the efficiency of the NE as compared with the social optimum, and demonstrate that the PoA is upper-bounded by 3/2. Next, we propose two fully-distributed algorithms that provably converge to the unique NE without revealing privacy-sensitive parameters from the slice tenants. Moreover, we introduce an adaptive pricing mechanism of the wireless resources to improve the network owner's profit. We evaluate the performance of our algorithms through simulations and an experimental testbed deployed on the Amazon EC2 cloud, both based on a real-world dataset of base stations from the OpenCellID project. Results conclude that our algorithms converge to the NE rapidly and achieve near-optimal performance, while our pricing mechanism effectively improves the profit of the network owner.},

  abstract = {The notions of softwarization and virtualization of the radio access network (RAN) of next-generation (5G) wireless systems are ushering in a vision where applications and services are physically decoupled from devices and network infrastructure. This crucial aspect will ultimately enable the dynamic deployment of heterogeneous services by different network operators over the same physical infrastructure. RAN slicing is a form of 5G virtualization that allows network infrastructure owners to dynamically ``slice'' and ``serve'' their network resources (i.e., spectrum, power, antennas, among others) to different mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs), according to their current needs. Once the slicing policy (i.e., the percentage of resources assigned to each MVNO) has been computed, a major challenge is how to allocate spectrum resources to MVNOs in such a way that (i) the slicing policy defined by the network owner is enforced; and (ii) the interference among different MVNOs is minimized. In this article, we mathematically formalize the RAN slicing enforcement problem (RSEP) and demonstrate its NP-hardness. For this reason, we design three approximation algorithms that render the solution scalable as the RSEP increases in size. We extensively evaluate their performance through simulations and experiments on a testbed made up of 8 software-defined radio peripherals. Experimental results reveal that not only do our algorithms enforce the slicing policies, but can also double the total network throughput when intra-MVNO power control policies are used in conjunction.},

Existing work in this area has addressed RAN slicing at different levels of network abstractions, but has often neglected the multitude of tightly intertwined inter-level operations involved in real-world slicing systems. For this reason, this article discusses a novel framework for operator-to-waveform 5G RAN slicing. In the proposed framework, slicing operations are treated holistically, including MNO's selection of base stations (BSs) and maximum number of users, down to the waveform-level scheduling of resource blocks. Experimental results show that the proposed framework provides up to 150\% improvement in terms of number of resource blocks that can be used to enable 5G transmission technologies that require coordination and synchronization among BSs.},

  abstract = {The Long-Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) communication protocol can be adapted for the Internet of Things (IoT) due to its long geographical coverage, low energy consumption, high capacity, open business model, and low cost. Recently, both academia and industry are attracted to LoRaWAN because of its recent developments and applicability in the IoT environment. Mostly, the IoT concept involves massive end devices distributed over a wide topographical area, hence establishing a high density and large-scale environment. LoRaWAN makes use of six orthogonal spreading factors (SFs) in order to improve spectral efficiency and increase the capacity. In this paper, we focus on the LoRaWAN class A network end devices and the problem of network scalability under high-density urban environment by using both the confirmed and unconfirmed mode of communication. Simulation results show that the urban environment has a high impact on the distribution of SFs, thus leading to low network performance in terms of success ratio. We also observed that the use of acknowledgment limits the scalability of the LoRaWAN due to the duty cycle constraints. However, this study further reveals that elevating the antenna height can significantly improve the performance in an urban area.},

  abstract = {Low-power wide-area networking (LPWAN) has gained much attention recently and offers significant potential to support a large number of Internet of Things (IoT) applications. For device simplicity, LPWANs tend to use a simple channel access control protocol such as Aloha, which impacts performance. While several LPWAN technologies are available, we specifically focus on the Long Range (LoRa) in this paper. Our goal in this study is to search for a channel access control protocol in conjunction with the LoRa physical layer that can improve network performance in terms of reliability, throughput, energy consumption, and yet retain simplicity. We analyze a range of channel access control protocols, such as pure Aloha, delay before transmit, random frequency hopping, and carrier sense multiple access (CSMA). Our experiments use available periodic and event-based data traffic generation models for Internet of Things applications. Our results show that, CSMA and random frequency hopping demonstrate significantly better performance for both periodic and event-based data traffic models. Moreover, CSMA also exhibits scalability features in terms of the number of nodes in a network and data traffic generation models.},

The practical realization of such capability still raises numerous technical challenges, both in the Core and RAN parts of the 5G system. Through a comprehensive analysis of the impact that the realization of RAN slicing has on the different layers of the radio interface protocol architecture, this article proposes a framework for the support and specification of RAN slices based on the definition of a set of configuration descriptors that characterize the features, policies and resources to be put in place across the radio protocol layers of a next-generation RAN node.},

  abstract = {Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) networks are making spectacular progress from design, standardisation, to commercialisation. At this time of fast-paced adoption, it is of utmost importance to analyse how well these technologies will scale as the number of devices connected to the Internet of Things (IoT) inevitably grows. In this letter, we provide a stochastic geometry framework for modelling the performance of a single gateway LoRa network, a leading LPWA technology. Our analysis formulates unique peculiarities of LoRa, including its chirp spread-spectrum modulation technique, regulatory limitations on radio duty cycle, and use of ALOHA protocol on top, all of which are not as common in today's commercial cellular networks. We show that the coverage probability drops exponentially as the number of end-devices grows due to interfering signals using the same spreading sequence. We conclude that this fundamental limiting factor is perhaps more significant towards LoRa scalability than for instance spectrum restrictions. Our derivations for co-spreading factor interference found in LoRa networks enables rigorous scalability analysis of such networks.},
  annotation = {In \textbackslash{}cite\{georgiou\_low\_2017\} the effects of interference in a single gateway LoRa network have been investigated.\\
Unlike other wireless networks,\\
LoRa employs an adaptive chirp spread spectrum modulation scheme,\\
thus extending the communication range in absence of any interference.\\
Interference is however present when signals simultaneously collide in time,\\
frequency,\\
and spreading factor.

Leveraging tools from stochastic geometry,\\
the authors of \textbackslash{}cite\{georgiou\_low\_2017\} have formulated and solved two link-outage conditions that can be used to evaluate the LoRA behavior.

\textbackslash{}citet\{georgiou\_low\_2017\} showed how the coverage probability drops exponentially as the number of network devices grows due to the interfering signals using the same spreading factor,\\
which is concluded to be perhaps the most significant limits towards scalability on LoRa.

~

\textbackslash{}citet\{georgiou\_low\_2017\} provide a stochastic geometry framework for modeling the performance of a single gateway LoRa network.\\
They model the co-spreading factor interference assuming a single bandwidth frequency for all the nodes and they measure the outage and coverage probabilities based on the signal to noise ratio and the co-spreading sequence interference.\\
Their analysis shows that the coverage probability drops exponentially as the number of end-devices grows due to interfering signals using the same spreading sequence.

~

\textbackslash{}citet\{georgiou\_low\_2017\} provide a stochastic geometry framework for modeling the performance of a single channel LoRa network.\\
Two independent link-outage conditions are studied,\\
one which is related to SNR (i.e.\\
range) and another one which is related to co-spreading factor interference.\\
The authors argue that LoRa networks will inevitably become interference-limited,\\
as end device coverage probability decays exponentially with increasing number of end devices.\\
The authors report that this is mostly caused by co-spreading factor interference and that the low duty cycle and chirp orthogonality found in LoRa do little to mitigate this.\\
Finally,\\
the authors note that the lack of a packet-level software simulation is hindering the study into the performance of LoRa.\\
It would be interesting to combine the authors' modeling of co-spreading factor interference with our ns-3 error model,\\

  abstract = {This paper proposes a novel method of selecting battery-optimal transmission settings for moving nodes in Long Range (LoRa) system. In LoRa communication, transmission setting plays an important role as it affects coverage range, data rate, and battery consumption. Therefore, its optimal configuration is required to ensure successful communication with long battery life. However, with small data rate and resourcelimited LoRa nodes, configuration of optimal settings becomes challenging. Current solutions require multiple transmissions for fixed distance between nodes and gateways to achieve the optimal settings. The existing methods become unsuitable for moving nodes because of continuous change in distance between the nodes and the gateways. Thus, each transmission would require different optimal setting. Due to lack of such configuration method, conventional method uses same fixed high energy setting for all transmissions to ensure high reliability, which results in shorter battery life. To minimize energy consumption without affecting reliability, the proposed method dynamically configures the optimal setting for each transmission depending on the distance between current location of the moving node and the nearest gateway, using path loss estimation. The simulation result shows that, for 95\% reliability, the proposed method achieves 47\% reduction in energy consumption as compared with conventional method.},

  abstract = {We consider the resource allocation for the virtualized OFDMA uplink cloud radio access network (C-RAN), where multiple wireless operators (OPs) share the C-RAN infrastructure and resources owned by an infrastructure provider (InP). The resource allocation is designed through studying tightly coupled problems at two different levels. The upper-level problem aims at slicing the fronthaul capacity and cloud computing resources for all OPs to maximize the weighted profits of OPs and InP considering practical constraints on the fronthaul capacity and cloud computation resources. Moreover, the lower-level problems maximize individual OPs' sum rates by optimizing users' transmission rates and quantization bit allocation for the compressed I/Q baseband signals. We develop a two-stage algorithmic framework to address this two-level resource allocation design. In the first stage, we transform both upper-level and lowerlevel problems into corresponding problems by relaxing underlying discrete variables to the continuous ones. We show that these relaxed problems are convex and we develop fast algorithms to attain their optimal solutions. In the second stage, we propose two methods to round the optimal solution of the relaxed problems and achieve a final feasible solution for the original problem. Numerical studies confirm that the proposed algorithms outperform two greedy resource allocation algorithms and their achieved sum rates are very close to sum rate upper-bound obtained by solving relaxed problems. Moreover, we study the impacts of different parameters on the system sum rate, performance tradeoffs, and illustrate insights on a potential system operating point and resource provisioning issues.},

This paper is concerned with the performance and scalability of LORA networks, a leading LPWAN technology. Several recently published articles have analyzed the ability of LORA networks to scale, i.e., their ability to support increased traffic and number of nodes. This work proposes to employ message replication and gateways with multiple receive antennas to achieve, respectively, time and spatial diversity. The paper presents the proposed schemes and evaluates them through theoretical analysis and computer simulations. Results show that LORA networks are highly sensitive to the increase in user and traffic density, but both message replication and multiple antennas can enhance performance. Message replication has an optimum number of message copies for each network configuration, and its utilization is more beneficial in low-density networks, while the use of multiple receive antennas at the gateway is always beneficial.},

  abstract = {LORA networks have been gaining momentum as an accessible and open solution for massive connectivity in the Internet-of-Things. Besides the popularity, however, academic research has shown that the technology has limitations.

  abstract = {In this paper, we consider a three-level hierarchical structure for resource allocation in the radio access network (RAN) slicing. The infrastructure provider (InP) allocates the RAN slices to the mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs), and the MVNOs then allocate the radio resources to the users. It is challenging for the InP to determine resource allocation strategy efficiently due to the selfish strategic responses of both the MVNOs and the users. To handle this issue, we propose a tri-level Stackelberg game to jointly solve the frequency and power allocation and payment negotiation problem among the three levels. Simulation results verify a general market principle that the more the MVNOs focus on revenue collecting, the lower payoff the InP and the users will obtain.},

Among various data transmission technologies, LoRa is an Internet of Things (IoT)-based wireless communication technology, characterized by its long communication distance up to a few kilometers and low power consumption. Therefore, LoRa is an appropriate candidate for data transmission in smart grids. In this study, the performance of a LoRa device is examined. Based on the experimental results, a routing algorithm that uses the AODV is developed for the LoRa device, and the algorithm enables a long-chain topology suitable for data transmission in a smart grid. A multi-hop mechanism is simulated to ensure a high final receiving rate of packets, by finding the optimal path with the least number of hops in the transmission topology for a power transmission line. The simulation results show a great performance of the proposed algorithm in long distance transmission.},

  abstract = {The performance of Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs), where LoRa networks are included, has spurred much interest in recent times due to the high interest in connecting more and more devices to the so-called Internet of Things (IoT). The massive number of connected devices associated to its random spatial deployment and random network access introduce new degrees of freedom, demanding for innovative performance evaluation approaches. In this paper we study the interference caused to a LoRa gateway due to the uplink transmissions of multiple coexisting LoRa devices. By admitting an uniform spatial distribution of the devices, we show that the aggregate interference caused to a LoRa gateway follows a nonGaussian distribution and its power can be approximated by a sum of independent non-identical gamma random variables. Our work adopts a typical LoRaWAN operating scenario where the transmissions of LoRa Class A devices are affected by path-loss, shadowing and Rayleigh fading. Numerical results obtained with the modeling methodology are compared with simulation results, and the validation of the proposed model is discussed for different transmission probabilities.},

However, the limited bandwidth available for physical layer modulation in LoRa makes it unsuitable for high bit rate data transfer from devices like image sensors. In this paper, we propose a new method for mangrove forest monitoring in Malaysia, wherein we transfer image sensor data over the LoRa physical layer (PHY) in a node-to-node network model. In implementing this method, we produce a novel scheme for overcoming the bandwidth limitation of LoRa. With this scheme the images, which requires high data rate to transfer, collected by the sensor are encrypted as hexadecimal data and then split into packets for transfer via the LoRa physical layer (PHY). To assess the quality of images transferred using this scheme, we measured the packet loss rate, peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and structural similarity (SSIM) index of each image. These measurements verify the proposed scheme for image transmission, and support the industrial and academic trend which promotes LoRa as the future solution for IoT infrastructure.},

  abstract = {LoRa is a long-range, low power, low bit rate and single-hop wireless communication technology. It is intended to be used in Internet of Things (IoT) applications involving battery-powered devices with low throughput requirements. A LoRaWAN network consists of multiple end nodes that communicate with one or more gateways. These gateways act like a transparent bridge towards a common network server. The amount of end devices and their throughput requirements will have an impact on the performance of the LoRaWAN network. This study investigates the scalability in terms of the number of end devices per gateway of single-gateway LoRaWAN deployments. First, we determine the intra-technology interference behavior with two physical end nodes, by checking the impact of an interfering node on a transmitting node. Measurements show that even under concurrent transmission, one of the packets can be received under certain conditions. Based on these measurements, we create a simulation model for assessing the scalability of a single gateway LoRaWAN network. We show that when the number of nodes increases up to 1000 per gateway, the losses will be up to 32\%. In such a case, pure Aloha will have around 90\% losses. However, when the duty cycle of the application layer becomes lower than the allowed radio duty cycle of 1\%, losses will be even lower. We also show network scalability simulation results for some IoT use cases based on real data.},

Although LPWANs attract the interest of industry and network operators, it faces certain constraints related to energy consumption, network coverage and quality of service. In this paper we demonstrate the possibility to optimize the performance of the LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) technology, one of the most widely used LPWAN technology. We suggest that nodes use light-weight learning methods, namely, multi-armed bandit algorithms, to select the communication parameters (spreading factor and emission power). Extensive simulations show that such learning methods allow to manage the trade-off between energy consumption and packet loss much better than an Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) algorithm adapting spreading factors and transmission powers on the basis of Signal to Interference and Noise Ratio (SINR) values.},

  abstract = {The fundamental properties of long-range (LoRa) performance have been revealed by previous research, but advanced issues remain unresolved. This paper tackles three technical challenges that are confronted when establishing a LoRa network on a smart energy campus testbed in Korea. First, the communication range of LoRa in a combined indoor and outdoor environment has yet to be determined. To address this problem, this study builds a LoRa testbed from which we measure the propagation properties of radio signals in a combined environment. Then, we establish a simplified path loss model for LoRa PHY and compute the communication range. Next, national regulations enforce the use of the Listen-Before-Talk (LBT) scheduling scheme, but its performance has never been examined. This paper enumerates the impacts of LBT, threshold values, back-off algorithms, and application parameters on LoRa Medium Access Control (MAC) performance. Last, the application parameters required by the smart energy scenario influence LoRa performance, but their impacts have been scarcely reported. Based on the application parameters and experimental results, this paper proposes a strategy to deploy LoRa gateway(s) and nodes on the campus. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first work that considers performance issues when establishing a LoRa network on a real-world application testbed.},

The realization of network slicing is particularly challenging in the Radio Access Network (RAN) part, where multiple slices can be multiplexed over the same radio channel and Radio Resource Management (RRM) functions shall be used to split the cell radio resources and achieve the expected behaviour per slice. In this context, this paper describes the key design and implementation aspects of a Software-Defined RAN (SD-RAN) experimental testbed with slicing support. The testbed has been designed consistently with the slicing capabilities and related management framework established by 3GPP in Release 15. The testbed is used to demonstrate the provisioning of RAN slices (e.g. preparation, commissioning and activation phases) and the operation of the implemented RRM functionality for slice-aware admission control and scheduling.},

  abstract = {Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs) emerged to cover the needs of Internet of Things (IoT)-devices for operational longevity and long operating range. Among LPWANs, Long Range (LoRa) WAN has been the most promising; an upcoming IoT protocol, already adopted by big mobile operators like KPN and TTN. With LoRaWANs, IoT-devices transmit data to their corresponding gateways over many kilometers in a single hop and with 1\% duty-cycle. However, in a LoRa network, any device claims the channel for data-transmission without performing channel-sensing or synchronization with other devices. This increases humongously the number of collisions of information-packets when the number of IoT-devices that are connected per gateway increases. To improve the utilization of the channel, we propose the application of persistent-Carrier Sense Multiple Access (pCSMA) protocols on the MAC layer of LoRaWANs. In this manuscript, we report on the initial design of a p-CSMA component for the simulation of LoRa networks in ns3 1. In particular, the classes adding p-CSMA functionality to the IoT-devices are presented. Additionally, the dependencies and relations between these classes and an existing LoRaWAN module on which they apply are detailed. Further, we evaluate this new p-CSMA LoRaWAN module in terms of Packet Reception Ratio (PRR) by simulating LoRa networks. The current report is the first step in the creation of a holistic p-CSMA module, directed to support network-researchers and connoisseurs in simulating all aspects of LoRa networks in ns3.},

attention must be payed to the fact that having many EDs that defer their transmission because of a low value of p may lead to channel under-utilization.

  abstract = {The LoRaWAN communication protocol can be used for the implementation of the IoT (Internet of Things) concept. Currently, most of the information regarding the scalability of the LoRa technology is commercial and deals with the best-case scenario. Thus, we need realistic models, enabling the proper assessment of the performance level. Most of the time, the IoT concept entails a large number of nodes distributed over a wide geographical area, therefore forming a high density, large-scale architecture. It is important to determine the number of collisions so that we can assess the network performance. The present paper aims at assessing the performance level of the LoRaWAN technology by analyzing the number of packet collisions that can occur. Thus, this paper determines the maximum number of LoRa nodes that can communicate with a Gateway considering the LoRaWAN protocol specifications. Furthermore, we have proposed a series of solutions for reducing the number of collisions and increasing the capacity of the communication channel.},

  abstract = {Multitenant cellular network slicing has been gaining huge interest recently. However, it is not well-explored under the heterogeneous cloud radio access network (H-CRAN) architecture. This paper proposes a dynamic network slicing scheme for multitenant H-CRANs, which takes into account tenants' priority, baseband resources, fronthaul and backhaul capacities, quality of service (QoS) and interference. The framework of the network slicing scheme consists of an upper-level, which manages admission control, user association and baseband resource allocation; and a lower-level, which performs radio resource allocation among users. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve a higher network throughput, fairness and QoS performance compared to several baseline schemes.},

  abstract = {Although many techniques exist to transfer data from the widely distributed sensors that make up the Internet of Things (IoT) (e.g., using 3G/4G networks or cables), these methods are associated with prohibitively high costs, making them impractical for real-life applications. Recently, several emerging wireless technologies have been proposed to provide long-range communication for IoT sensors. Among these, LoRa has been examined for long-range performance. Although LoRa shows good performance for long-range transmission in the countryside, its radio signals can be attenuated over distance, and buildings, trees, and other radio signal sources may interfere with the signals. Our observations show that in urban areas, LoRa requires dense deployment of LoRa gateways (GWs) to ensure that indoor LoRa devices can successfully transfer data back to remote GWs. Wireless mesh networking is a solution for increasing communication range and packet delivery ratio (PDR) without the need to install additional GWs. This paper presents a LoRa mesh networking system for large-area monitoring of IoT applications. We deployed 19 LoRa mesh networking devices over an 800 m \texttimes{} 600 m area on our university campus and installed a GW that collected data at 1-min intervals. The proposed LoRa mesh networking system achieved an average 88.49\% PDR, whereas the star-network topology used by LoRa achieved only 58.7\% under the same settings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first academic study discussing LoRa mesh networking in detail and evaluating its performance via real experiments.},

In this article, we jointly analyze interferences in the timefrequency domain using a stochastic geometry model assuming the total time-frequency resources to be a two-dimensional plane and transmissions from Internet of Things (IoT) devices timefrequency patterns on this plane. To evaluate the interference, we quantify the overlap between the information packets: provided that the overlap is not too strong, the packets are not necessarily lost due to capture effect. This flexible model can be used for multiple medium access scenarios and is especially adapted to the random time-frequency access schemes used in Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs). By characterizing the outage probability and throughput, our approach permits to evaluate the performance of two representative LPWA technologies Sigfox R and LoRaWAN R .

  abstract = {Along with enhanced mobile broadband and ultrareliable low latency communication, massive connectivity has been one of the key requirements for enabling technologies of 5G. For IoT, low power consumption and wide area coverage for end devices (ED) are important figures of merit, for which LoRa, SigFox and Narrow Band-IoT are dominant technologies. In this letter, we analyze LoRa systems for increasing average system packet success probability (PSP) under unslotted ALOHA random access protocol. The lower bound for average system PSP is derived when many contending EDs are transmitting by stochastic geometry. And it is shown that the average system PSP can be maximized by properly allocating an SF to each traffic, which also maximizes connectivity of EDs. We formulate an optimization problem for maximizing the average system PSP to propose a sub-optimal SF allocation scheme to each traffic. Analysis on PSP is validated through simulations, and comparison with existing schemes reveals that our proposed scheme achieves the highest PSP and so the maximum connectivity.},

It was developed a path loss model where devices inside the buildings may be affected by building penetration losses.\\
There were executed simulations with thousands of devices following a Pareto distribution.\\
It was concluded that LoRaWAN with the ADR scheme may scale well only if there are numerous gateways suitably deployed across the system.\\
i.e.,\\
a packet success rate of 95\textbackslash\% for 15000 devices is attained only if there are 75 gateways.

As a result,\\
it lowers the probability of collisions and minimizes the ToA.\\

the GW is chosen based on the received power and SFs are allocated for the transmission.\\
The GW is configured with 8 received paths with 3 channels in total.\\
These receiving paths are assigned to each channel for uplink transmission.\\
However,\\

The authors in \textbackslash{}cite\{magrin\_performance\_2017\} proposed a complete LoRa module.\\
It features MAC commands,\\
diferent overlapping networks and multigateway support.\\
Besides these interesting features,\\
this module has some drawbacks.\\
First,\\
it can only send LoRa messages,\\
so it is impossible to simulate the efect of interference.\\
Next,\\
similar chirp rates do not have efect on each other.\\
Due to the chirp spread spectrum technique,\\
spreading factor 9 with 125 kHz bandwidth has a similar chirp rate compared to spreading factor 11 with a 250 kHz bandwidth.\\
Another small drawback is that all the gateways in this model are virtually directly connected to the network server,\\
so the packets cannot be routed over IP.

  abstract = {LoRaWAN is an emerging Low-Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technology, which is gaining momentum thanks to its flexibility and ease of deployment. Conversely to other LPWAN solutions, LoRaWAN indeed permits the configuration of several network parameters that affect different network performance indexes, such as energy efficiency, fairness, and capacity, in principle making it possible to adapt the network behavior to the specific requirements of the application scenario. Unfortunately, the complex and sometimes elusive interactions among the different network components make it rather difficult to predict the actual effect of a certain parameters setting, so that flexibility can turn into a stumbling block if not deeply understood. In this paper we shed light on such complex interactions, by observing and explaining the effect of different parameters settings in some illustrative scenarios. The simulation-based analysis reveals various trade-offs and highlights some inefficiencies in the design of the LoRaWAN standard. Furthermore, we show how significant performance gains can be obtained by wisely setting the system parameters, possibly in combination with some novel network management policies.},

In this paper, an analysis of this protocol through a performance evaluation of a permanent outdoor LoRaWAN tested is presented. To ensure accurate results, tests lasted at least 17 hours and required 1000 packets per node. The evaluation focused on the impact that the Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) scheme, payload length, link checks and acknowledgements had on the packet delivery ratio (PDR) of the testbed. The collected data showed that enabling the ADR scheme reduced the PDR. The ADR scheme had six data rates, which consist of a spreading factor (SF) and bandwidth (BW) combination, to choose from. Analysis revealed that the scheme primarily assigning either the fastest data rate (SF7BW250) or the slowest (SF12BW125) to nodes, regardless of distance. Furthermore, the scheme's assignments show signs of oscillation, with nodes being instructed to abruptly change between SFs. The impact of payload length and link checks on the PDR was not pronounced but enabling acknowledgements did show significant improvements.},

  abstract = {Recent technological innovations allow compact radios to transmit over long distances with minimal energy consumption and could drastically affect the way Internet of Things (IoT) technologies communicate in the near future. By extending the communication range of links, it is indeed possible to reduce the network diameter to a point that each node can communicate with almost every other node in the network directly. This drastically simplifies communication, removing the need of routing, and significantly reduces the overhead of data collection. Long-range low-power wireless technology, however, is still at its infancy, and it is yet unclear (i) whether it is sufficiently reliable to complement existing short-range and cellular technologies and (ii) which radio settings can sustain a high delivery rate while maximizing energy-efficiency. To shed light on this matter, this paper presents an extensive experimental study of the reliability of LoRa , one of the most promising long-range low-power wireless technologies to date. We focus our evaluation on the impact of physical layer settings on the effective data rate and energy efficiency of communications. Our results show that it is often not worth tuning parameters, thereby reducing the data rate in order to maximize the probability of successful reception, especially on links at the edge of their communication range. Furthermore, we study the impact of environmental factors on the performance of LoRa, and show that higher temperatures significantly decrease the received signal strength and may drastically affect packet reception.},

Our results suggest that the resources used to process packets coming from jammers could be 100 times higher than that of regular end-devices, and (iii) the network performance impact of jammers is highly correlated with the jammer class. We have shown that channel-oblivious jammers impacts the network performance widely, while channel-aware jammers impact the network locally.

  abstract = {Spectrum decision is the ability of a cognitive radio (CR) system to select the best available spectrum band to satisfy dynamic spectrum access network (DSAN) users' quality of service (QoS) requirements without causing harmful interference to primary users. In order to have reliable spectrum decision, CR nodes or secondary users (SUs) should identify available spectrum bands and from these candidate spectrum, a SU can select channels which are suitable to meet user QoS requirements. This paper proposes an adaptive spectrum decision framework (ASDF) which is a channel allocation scheme that selects suitable channels from a list of available channels based on SU preferred options. The scheme relies on a geo-location spectrum database for identification of available chanels. Key parameters (i.e. available channel bandwidth, time, and power) are extracted from each available spectrum and tagged according to their level in order to build a matrix of available channels. Our ASDF then maps channels with SUs based on channel properties and SU preferred options. Simulation results show that our ASDF is reliable and consistent when it comes to channel selection. Furthermore, our scheme provides efficient bandwidth utilization when compared to the first come first serve channel allocation scheme.},

  abstract = {In this paper we discuss and analyze the recently proposed LoRa low power wide area network (LPWAN) technology when used under the European frequency regulations. First of all, we derive the performance metrics of a single LoRaWAN end device, namely uplink throughput and data transmission time. Then we analyze for several illustrative application scenarios the maximum number of end devices which can be served by a single LoRaWAN base station and discuss the spatial distribution of these devices. It is shown that subject to the channel composition and application requirements, a single cell may include several millions of devices. Also, we show that the capacity of the uplink channel available to a LoRaWAN node strongly depends on the distance from the base station and does not exceed 2 kbit/s. In the concluding section we summarize and discuss the obtained results, and point out few issues which need to be taken into account when making an application using LoRa or deploying a LoRa network.},
  annotation = {The paper \textbackslash{}cite\{mikhaylov\_analysis\_2016\} analyses the performance of the LoRa LPWAN technology by showing that,\\
in accordance to the specifications,\\
a single end device located close to the base station can feature an uplink data transfer channel of only 2 kbit/s at best.\\
In terms of scalability,\\
they show that a single LoRaWAN cell can potentially serve several millions of devices sending few bytes of data per day.\\
Nonetheless,\\
they showed that only a small portion of these devices can be located sufficiently far away from the base station.

\textbackslash{}citet\{mikhaylov\_analysis\_2016\} discussed LoRa performance under European frequency regulations.\\
They studied the performance metrics of a single end device,\\
then the spatial distribution of several end devices.\\
They showed LoRa strengths (large coverage and good scalability for low uplink traffic) and weaknesses (low reliability,\\
delays,\\
and poor performance of downlink traffic).

~

In one of the first works on this topic,\\
\textbackslash{}citet\{mikhaylov\_analysis\_2016\} present an analysis of the capacity and scalability of LoRa LPWANs.\\
The authors perform an analytical analysis of the maximum throughput for a single LoRaWAN end device,\\
taking into account such factors as RDC and the influence of receive windows.\\
The authors note that receive windows drastically increase the time between subsequent transmissions and that RDC restrictions reduce the maximum throughput further.\\
The authors applied the same methodology to determine the capacity of LoRaWAN based on ALOHA access.\\
While it is true that the LoRaWAN MAC access is an ALOHA scheme,\\
empirical data has shown that the assumptions made in pure ALOHA access do not adequately model a LoRaWAN network (see figure 4 in \textbackslash{}cite\{bor\_lora\_2016\}).\\
Specifically,\\
it fails to model the interference between concurrent transmissions as pure ALOHA assumes concurrent transmissions are always lost regardless of their received power levels,\\
timings and the presence of forward error correction.

~

\textbackslash{}citet\{mikhaylov\_analysis\_2016\} analyzed and assessed the throughput of the LoRa technology,\\
determining the airtime of a packet.\\
Therefore,\\
it is possible to estimate the maximum number of nodes that can communicate with a Gateway module.\\
The purpose of this paper was to analyze the ALOHA communication mechanism.\\
The results are obtained at an empirical level.

~

\textbackslash{}citet\{mikhaylov\_analysis\_2016\} showed that a LoRa cell can potentially serve a large number of devices,\\
but devices are limited to sending only a few bytes of data per day.\\
The majority of devices need to be located in the vicinity of the gateway:\\
only less than 10\textbackslash\% can reside at distances longer\\
than 5 km.\\
Another factor that limits scalability is the use of acknowledgements\textemdash{}as the gateway is subject to the same ETSI restrictions on the duty cycle,\\
it cannot acknowledge each packet in a dense network.

~

In \textbackslash{}cite\{mikhaylov\_analysis\_2016\},\\
multiple annuli LoRaWAN R cell structure is well modelled and illustrated with a few applicative scenarios.\\
This structure is considered in our article but channel effects and capture effect are added to our model thus making it more complete and realistic.},

Finally,\\
the work most closely related to ours is \textbackslash{}cite\{mikhaylov\_lorawan\_2017\},\\
an empirical study of interference between LoRa networks (a pre-print at the time of this writing).\\
The paper investigates the interference case when one LoRa radio uses conventional LoRa modulation and the other one uses 2-GFSK modulation,\\
which is also used in IEEE 802.15.4g.\\
(Support for 2-GFSK is required in the LoRa specification.) The experiments use randomized packet lengths and inter-arrival times for both the sender and the interferer.\\
The inter-arrival times are a significant fraction of (and in some cases longer than) the packet transmission times.\\
This means that the proportion of time that the channel is interfered varies depending on the choice of LoRa transmission parameters.\\
As a consequence,\\
the results reflect a mix of heavily and minimally interfered packets.\\
It is therefore hard to draw conclusions about the interference behavior,\\
beyond the specific empirical observations.\\
By contrast,\\
we are doing much more controlled experiments that allow us to examine the interaction between the two modulations in detail.},

  abstract = {LoRa's long-range and low-power features have made it an attractive candidate for IoT devices in various fields. In this work, we present an enhanced LoRaWAN protocol. LoRaWAN MAC protocol is characterized by the restrictive use of the channel, limited by the regulatory authorities to a 1\% duty cycle per cycle (i.e., 36 s per hour) per node. This regulation penalizes the nodes which require a channel access time greater than the limited duty cycle to occasionally transmit a large amount of data such as video surveillance or access control information in applications like smart school surveillance. However, some other nodes like environment sensors sharing a same LoRaWAN server may send very small amounts of information (e.g. temperature, humidity, ...) and under-use the authorized activity time of 1\% duty cycle. Hence the idea of implementing an activity time sharing mechanism among nodes that allows devices to borrow additional activity time from a device or set of devices that have completed the transmission of their packets and do not need the remaining time of the corresponding duty cycle. Our work extends and improves the activity time sharing mechanism initially proposed in [1]. Instead of FIFO sharing-time allocation based on a global activity time, which may lead to the starvation of the nodes that are others than that in the head of FIFO line, we propose a new time allocation algorithm based on the classification of the different requests according to their needs in terms of their QoS requirements. It allows to satisfy a larger number of nodes requiring extra time, with less control overheads while ensuring fairness. Our time-sharing algorithm has been implemented and tested on the wasp-mote chip of libelium, showing the performance improvement and its practical usability.},

Both methods can be implemented by slight modification of the ordinary packet scheduling algorithm such as the proportional fairness algorithm, and guarantee resource isolation by limiting the maximum number of resource blocks (RBs) allocated to each slice. Moreover, since both methods flexibly allocate RBs to the entire system bandwidth, there are cases in which the throughput performance is improved compared to when the system bandwidth is divided in a static manner, especially in a frequency selective channel environment. Numerical results show the superiority of these methods to dividing simply the system bandwidth in a static manner, and show the difference between the features of the methods in terms of the throughput performance of each slice.},

This flexibility provides either a long range at the cost of a lower data rate or higher throughput at the cost of low sensitivity, so a shorter range. In this paper, we analyze the flexibility of LoRa and propose various strategies to adapt its radio parameters (such as the spreading factor, bandwidth, and transmission power) to different deployment scenarios. We compute the energy consumption of LoRa transceivers using various radio configurations in both star and mesh topologies. Our simulation results show that in a star topology, we can achieve the optimal scaling-up/down strategy of LoRa radio parameters to obtain either a high data rate or a long range while respecting low energy consumption. In mesh networks, energy consumption is optimized by exploiting various radio configurations and the network topology (e.g., the number of hops, the network density, the cell coverage). Finally, we propose a strategy to take advantage of both star and mesh topologies.},

The main LPWA research directions are about large scale networks to support massive number of devices, interference issues, link optimization and adaptability. Thus heterogeneous network deployments and Spreading Factor (SF) allocation strategies need to be studied. In this paper, we investigate the performance of homogeneous networks (i.e. when all the nodes select the same LoRa configuration) and heterogeneous networks (i.e. when each node selects its LoRa configuration according to its link budget or their needs) for large scale deployments (up to 10000 nodes per gateway). For that purpose we have developed a LoRa Module, based on improved WSNet simulator, including a spectrum usage abstraction, the co-channel rejection due to the quasi-orthogonality of SFs and the gateway capture effect. Simulation results show the performance comparison in terms of reliability, network capacity and power consumption for homogeneous and heterogeneous deployments as a function of the number of nodes and the traffic intensity. The comparison shows the benefits of the heterogeneous deployment where each node selects its configuration according to its link budget.},

  abstract = {Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs) are prominent technologies in the field of the Internet of Things (loT). Due to the long range capabilities and low energy consumption, Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs) are the ideal technologies to send small data occasionally. With their unique characteristics, LPWANs can be used in many applications and in different environments such as urban, rural and even indoor. The work in this paper presents a study on the LPWAN LoRa technology, by testing and evaluating its range, signal quality properties and its performance in delivering data. Three distinct scenarios are proposed and tested, one rural and two urban scenarios in Portugal. The maximum communication range achieved was 5660 meters for the rural scenario and around 2000 meters for the urban ones, and we concluded that there are three essential scenario characteristics that influence the achieved results: distance, elevation difference and obstacles in the signal path.},

We systematically investigate interference interactions between LoRa and IEEE 802.15.4g networks. Our results show that LoRa can obtain high packet reception rates, even in presence of strong IEEE 802.15.4g interference. IEEE 802.15.4g is also shown to have some resilience to LoRa interference. Both effects are highly dependent on the LoRa radio's spreading factor and bandwidth configuration, as well as on the channelization. The results are shown to arise from the interaction between the two radios' modulation schemes. The data have implications for the design and analysis of protocols for both radio technologies.},

  abstract = {The deployment of a broadband public safety (PS) mobile network can be undertaken in different ways. One method involves combining commercial networks with private ones to reduce their deployment cost and time to market. In shared commercial networks, priorities should be defined to differentiate traffic not only between consumers and PS users but also between different PS organizations and type of services. Prioritization must also ensure that emergency calls are always served under normal conditions and during disasters. The recent advent of the fifth generation (5G) wireless standard introduces new technologies, such as network slicing (NS), which allows the provision of logical PS networks in a shared 5G system wherein each slice can be dedicated to an organization or to a type of service. However, 5G management and orchestration become a challenging task with NS, e.g., in handling resource allocation between slices with diverse requirements. Therefore, efficient solutions for slice resource allocation are required to facilitate this task. In this paper, we present a review of adaptive and dynamic resource allocation leveraging on heuristic and reinforcement learning-based algorithms that have been proposed in the recent literatures. The challenge in implementing these algorithms is to find the most suitable one for our problem, i.e., an algorithm that is highly scalable, able to solve problems immediately, and exhibits the best convergence properties in terms of speed and ability to find the global optimum.},

However, to be effective, IoT-based services could require different technologies and network topologies, even when addressing the same urban scenario. In this paper, we highlight this aspect and present two smart city testbeds developed in Italy. The first one concerns a smart infrastructure for public lighting and relies on a heterogeneous network using the IEEE 802.15.4 short-range communication technology, whereas the second one addresses smart-building applications and is based on the LoRa low-rate, long-range communication technology. The smart lighting scenario is discussed providing the technical details and the economic benefits of a large-scale (around 3000 light poles) flexible and modular implementation of a public lighting infrastructure, while the smart-building testbed is investigated, through measurement campaigns and simulations, assessing the coverage and the performance of the LoRa technology in a real urban scenario. Results show that a proper parameter setting is needed to cover large urban areas while maintaining the airtime sufficiently low to keep packet losses at satisfactory levels.},

In this context, this paper focuses on radio admission control as the function that controls the amount of radio resources assigned to the different tenants in a 5G radio access network. Specifically, a novel approach is proposed that includes profit-related metrics in the decision-making process, accounting for the additional extra incomes that can be obtained by sporadically granting additional capacity beyond the SLA level and for the penalties incurred due to potential SLA breaches.

Although multiple simultaneously emitted LoRa \textregistered{} transmissions can be processed by a single gateway exploiting the orthogonality of the spreading factors in addition to using multiple transmission sub-bands,\\
the nature of the ALOHAbased access to the medium inevitably leads to the presence of transmission collisions.

  abstract = {Up to recently, two main approaches were used for connecting the "things" in the growing Internet of Things (IoT) - one based on multi-hop mesh networks, using short-range technologies and unlicensed spectrum, and the other based on long-range cellular network technologies using corresponding licensed frequency bands. New type of connectivity used in LowPower Wide Area networks (LPWAN), challenges these approaches by using low-rate long-range transmission technologies in unlicensed sub-GHz frequency bands. In this paper, we do performance testing on one such star-topology network, based on Semtech's LoRaTM technology, and deployed in the city of Rennes - LoRa FABIAN. In order to check the quality of service (QoS) that this network can provide, generally and in given conditions, we conducted a set of performance measurements. We performed our tests by generating and then observing the traffic between IoT nodes and LoRa IoT stations using our LoRa FABIAN protocol stack. With our experimental setup, we were able to generate traffic very similar to the one that can be used by real application such as sensor monitoring. This let us extract basic performance metrics, such as packet error rate (PER), but also metrics related specifically to the LoRa physical layer, such as the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and Signal to Noise ratio (SNR), within various conditions. Our findings provide insight about the performance of LoRa networks, but also about evaluation methods for these type of networks. We gathered measurement data that we make freely available together with the tools we used.},

such as \textbackslash{}cite\{petric\_measurements\_2016\},\\
present measurements of existing LoRa systems and study the actual performance of the end devices with respect to their relative distance to the gateways.\\
They aim at optimising the parametrization of LoRa networks.\\
However,\\
due to the limited number of end devices considered in these studies,\\
it is difficult to gauge the scaling properties of LoRa networks,\\
for instance in terms of the maximum number of end devices supported with a given goodput rate.\\
Moreover,\\
these studies do not permit a fine-tuned analysis of collisions in LoRa networks.

For example,\\
in \textbackslash{}cite\{petric\_measurements\_2016-1\},\\
a real LoRaWAN deployment was evaluated and it was found that the base-station antenna location and elevation have great importance in the network performance.\\
The measurements were carried out using three different base-stations.\\

Long Range \textbackslash\& Low Power Networks for the Internet of Things.\\
In this case,\\

i.e.,\\
LoRa,\\
configuration parameters,\\

  annotation = {Activity Time Sharing Mechanism: \textbackslash{}cite\{pham\_qos\_2016\},\\
proposes a mechanism for sharing the channel occupancy time in order to improve the overall performance of the network.\\
We give more details on this mechanism,\\
to which we are interested in our work.

\textbackslash{}cite\{pham\_qos\_2016\} proposed an activity time sharing mechanism in a long-range unlicensed LoRa network to face the problem of activity time limitation in the case of video surveillance applications.\\
The proposed mechanism supposes that all devices that will participate in the sharing mechanism register with the LoRa gateway and announce their local remaining activity time (initially can be the total authorized activity time or just a fraction).\\
Thus,\\
the gateway computes the global activity time allowed for usage which can be an addition of the allowed time of each device ``Global Time'' (1) or just a fraction of it.\\
After it informs it to all devices which will share it.\\
This step is performed each cycle (every hour).\\
As long as this global activity time allows,\\
a node Di that exhausts its duty cycle (allocated activity time) and needs additional time to send its data borrows the remaining time from the global time.\\
A global view of the total remaining activity time is maintained by the LoRa Gateway (LR-BS) on reception of packets and sent back to devices at the appropriate moments.

GlobalT ime = n \texttimes{} 36 s (1) In \textbackslash{}cite\{pham\_qos\_2016\},\\
the author did not evaluate nor propose a mechanism for selecting devices that will benefit the shared extra time.\\
Indeed,\\
he limited himself to serving the first applicant.

Moreover,\\
\textbackslash{}cite\{pham\_qos\_2016\} assumes that all the nodes participating in the sharing mechanism must be on standby to be able to receive from the gateway the updated information of the global activity time and the list of nodes involved in the loan.\\
Otherwise they must wake-up periodically to receive this update.\\
This would not correspond to the behavior of class A nodes but rather to class B nodes.\\
We believe that the activity time sharing mechanism proposed in \textbackslash{}cite\{pham\_qos\_2016\} improves the quality of service but lacks an additional time allocation mechanism by a priority classification or a strategy that satisfies a larger number of requesting devices taking into account the range of a device and its battery level in the management of the allocation of additional time.\\
In the next section,\\
we will describe our solution to those above-mentioned issues.},

First, we analyze LoRa modulation numerically and show that collisions between packets of different SFs can indeed cause packet loss if the interference power received is strong enough. Second, we validate such findings using commercial devices, confirming our numerical results. Third, we modified and extended LoRaSim, an open-source LoRa simulator, to measure the impact of inter-SF collisions and fading (which was not taken into account previously in the simulator). Our results show that non-orthogonality of the SFs can deteriorate significantly the performance especially of higher SFs (10 to 12) and that fading has virtually no impact when multiple gateways are available in space diversity.},

  abstract = {Low-power and long-range communication technologies such as LoRa are becoming popular in IoT applications due to their ability to cover kilometers range with milliwatt of power consumption. One of the major drawbacks of LoRa is the data latency and the traffic congestion when the number of devices in the network increases. Especially, the latency arises due to the extreme duty cycling of LoRa end-nodes for reducing the overall energy consumption. To overcome this drawback, we propose a heterogeneous network architecture and an energy-efficient On-demand TDMA communication scheme improving both the device lifetime and the data latency of standard LoRa networks. We combine the capabilities of microwatt wake-up receivers to achieve ultra-low power states and pure asynchronous communication together with the long-range connectivity of LoRa. Experimental results show a data reliability of 100 \% and a round-trip latency on the order of milliseconds with end devices dissipating less than 46 mJ when active and 1.83 {$\mathrm{\mu}$}W during periods of inactivity, lasting up to 3 years on a 1200 mA h Lithium battery.},

  abstract = {The need for low power, long range and low cost connectivity to meet the requirements of IoT applications has led to the emergence of Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) networking technologies. The promise of these technologies to wirelessly connect massive numbers of geographically dispersed devices at a low cost continues to attract a great deal of attention in the academic and commercial communities. Several rollouts are already underway even though the performance of these technologies is yet to be fully understood. In light of these developments, tools to carry out `what-if analyses' and predeployment studies are needed to understand the implications of choices that are made at design time. While there are several promising technologies in the LPWA space, this paper specifically focuses on the LoRa/LoRaWAN technology. In particular, we present LoRaWANSim, a simulator which extends the LoRaSim tool to add support for the LoRaWAN MAC protocol, which employs bidirectional communication. This is a salient feature not available in any other LoRa simulator. Subsequently, we provide vital insights into the performance of LoRaWAN based networks through extensive simulations. In particular, we show that the achievable network capacity reported in earlier studies is quite optimistic. The introduction of downlink traffic can have a significant impact on the uplink throughput. The number of transmit attempts recommended in the LoRaWAN specification may not always be the best choice. We also highlight the energy consumption versus reliability trade-offs associated with the choice of number of retransmission attempts.},
  annotation = {The recent work presented by \textbackslash{}citet\{pop\_does\_2017\} studies the impact of bidirectional traffic in LoRaWAN by extending the LoRaSim simulator to include bidirectional LoRaWAN communication.\\
The resulting simulator is named LoRaWANSim.\\
Both our ns-3 module and LoRaWANSim allow to study the scalability of LoRaWAN networks.\\
Both works find that duty cycle limitations at the gateway limit the number of downlink messages (Ack or data) a gateway can send.\\
This problem grows worse as the end device density increases,\\
but can be partially mitigated by increasing gateway density (see section V-C).

The authors of \textbackslash{}cite\{pop\_does\_2017\} correctly identify that the absence of an acknowledgement,\\
does not necessarily mean that the link quality has decreased and that a node should decrease its data rate for subsequent retransmissions.

~

Actually,\\
decreasing the data rate might exacerbate this problem as detailed in \textbackslash{}cite\{pop\_does\_2017\}.\\
Notable differences between the two simulators include that the LoRaWANSim manuscript is limited to single gateway network,\\
while the ns-3 module provides support for multi-gateway LoRaWAN networks.\\
Secondly,\\
the collision models are quite different.\\
The ns-3 module builds on the error model derived from the complex baseband BER simulations,\\
while LoRaWANSim reuses the empirical model from LoRaSim.\\
Both collision models support the capture effect as well as modeling interference.\\
Under capture effect,\\
we understand the ability to receive an interfered transmission in the presence of one or more interferers as long as the SNR of the interfered transmission is sufficiently high for the transmission to be received error-free.\\
The LoRaWANSim collision model incorrectly assumes perfect orthogonality between spreading factors,\\
while the ns-3 module counts every transmission on the same channel with a different spreading factor as interference.\\
Furthermore,\\
the LoRaWANSim manuscript does not mention the 10\textbackslash\% RDC restriction that applies in the sub-\\
band of the RW2 channel in the EU.\\
This underestimates the downlink capacity in RW2.\\
Thirdly,\\
the SpectrumPhy model for the LoRa PHY in ns-3 enables modeling inter-technology interference,\\
which could facilitate studies on the interference between 802.11ah on LoRaWAN.\\
Finally,\\
the LoRaWANSim simulator does not appear to be open source although the manuscript is still under revision at this time.

~

~

\textbackslash{}citet\{pop\_does\_2017\} evaluated how LoRa WAN downlink impacts LoRa uplink goodput and coverage probability.\\
They considered the medium access control (MAC) layer and,\\
through simulations,\\
verified that if too many end-devices request delivery confirmation,\\
the downlink becomes unstable and unable to deliver several acknowledgment packets,\\
thus forcing network nodes to retry their transmissions,\\
ultimately flooding the network.

~

The study presented in \textbackslash{}cite\{pop\_does\_2017\} features a system-level analysis of LoRaWAN,\\
and gives significant insights on bottlenecks and network behavior in presence of downlink traffic.\\
However,\\
besides pointing out some flaws in the design of the LoRaWAN medium access scheme,\\
this work does not propose any way to improve the performance of the technology.

~

\textbackslash{}citet\{pop\_does\_2017\} extended the LoRaSim simulator by adding support for downlink transmissions.\\
The authors demonstrated that downlink transmissions in the network actually decrease the communication performance of the wireless connections.

In realizing the vision of the Internet of Things (IoT), LPWA technologies complement and sometimes supersede the conventional cellular and short range wireless technologies in performance for various emerging smart city and machine-to-machine (M2M) applications. This review paper presents the design goals and the techniques, which different LPWA technologies exploit to offer wide-area coverage to lowpower devices at the expense of low data rates. We survey several emerging LPWA technologies and the standardization activities carried out by different standards development organizations (e.g., IEEE, IETF, 3GPP, ETSI) as well as the industrial consortia built around individual LPWA technologies (e.g., LORa\texttrademark{} Alliance, WEIGHTLESS-SIG, and DASH7 Alliance). We further note that LPWA technologies adopt similar approaches, thus sharing similar limitations and challenges. This paper expands on these research challenges and identifies potential directions to address them. While the proprietary LPWA technologies are already hitting the market with large nationwide roll-outs, this paper encourages an active engagement of the research community in solving problems that will shape the connectivity of tens of billions of devices in the next decade.},

Within this family of possible technology choices, two different branches have emerged: the standards based on spreaded wideband communication and the standards based on narrowband communication, both promising to reach long range connectivity at very low power. More specifically, this paper focuses on chirp spread spectrum (CSS). This paper presents a detailed model of CSS, showing that the symbols are not perfectly orthogonal. The results show the potential communication ranges are close to narrowband networks and the robustness against interfering signals is 22 dB better for spreading factor 10 than BPSK. Although wideband communication is robust to interference, in long range communication, this robustness is insufficient due to the long range and the larger footprint. The large propagation losses due to the long range and the larger footprint make CSS prone to collisions with other noise sources, possibly larger than the coding gain.},

  abstract = {Long Range (LoRa) communication has been proposed to connect massive numbers of devices in large areas. LoRa itself is a physical layer technique. Together with the MAC layer solution LoRaWAN to realize IoT, they have attracted increasing attention from both industry and academia. In this work, we present our implemented LoRaWAN module for ns-3, to help boost the research in this rising area. Our implementation is compliant with the class A of the LoRaWAN 1.0 speciication. It is highly conigurable and thus can be easily used to exploit the impact of diferent parameters on LoRaWAN's performance. Our implemented lexible backbone architecture also allows for the easy integration of new protocols to improve the network performance. In the past two years, we have used this module to develop new protocols and algorithms to improve LoRaWAN's performance, in terms of reliability, capture efect, scalability, power consumption, among others. Our research outcomes have demonstrated the usefulness, lexibility, and conigurability of the proposed LoRaWAN ns-3 module. We have made the source code of our module publicly available1.},

  abstract = {Low power wide area networks are gaining interest to connect thousands of nodes to the internet of things. However, because the link budget in these networks is huge, nodes suffer from a near-far effect. Nodes far from the base station cannot send to the base station succesfully when closer nodes are transmitting, causing destructive collisions. LoRa, the considered technology in this paper, is a spread spectrum technology. It is known that spread spectrum is also sensitive to this effect. This paper presents a scheme to efficiently optimize the packet error rate fairness inside a LoRaWAN cell. This is achieved by optimizing the power and spreading factor for each node while avoiding near-far problems by allocating distant users to different channels. Simulations show that the packet error rate can be decreased up to 50\% for edge nodes in a moderate contention scenario where 1 node per 1000m2 transmits every 10 minutes.},
  annotation = {\textbackslash{}citet\{reynders\_power\_2017\} developed a scheme to efficiently assign the SF and the transmission power across the devices.

In \textbackslash{}cite\{reynders\_power\_2017\},\\
the authors compute the optimal SFs distribution to minimize the collision4 probability and propose a scheme to improve the fairness for nodes far from the station by optimally assigning SFs and transmit power values to the network nodes,\\
in order to reduce the packet error rate.

In \textbackslash{}cite\{reynders\_power\_2017\},\\
the authors present a scheme to optimize the packet error rate fairness to avoid near-far problems.

~

\textbackslash{}citet\{reynders\_power\_2017\} presented and evaluated a mechanism to optimize the fairness of packet error rates among nodes with different spreading factors.\\
We have applied a similar approach to derive the optimal distribution of spreading factors as a network-aware scheme in comparison with ADR+.\\
However,\\
the scenario considered in \textbackslash{}cite\{reynders\_power\_2017\} is such that all nodes in the network can reach the gateway with every spreading factor and every power setting,\\
i.e.,\\
all nodes are close to the gateway.\\
In contrast,\\
we consider a more realistic deployment scenario wherein nodes may only reach the gateway with specific spreading factors and transmission powers.

~

Similarly,\\
in \textbackslash{}cite\{reynders\_power\_2017\} power and spreading factor control algorithm is presented to achieve fairness in LoRa-based networks.\\
Existing research work on LoRa has largely ignored the investigation of different channel access control protocols to improve the performance of LoRa in terms of reliability,\\
throughput,\\
and energy consumption.\\
Therefore,\\
here we focus on investigating the impact of a range of channel access control protocols on a LoRa-based network.

  abstract = {A broad range of emerging applications require very low power, very long range yet low throughput communication. Different standards are being proposed to meet these novel requirements. In this paper, the technical differences between a wideband spread spectrum (LoRa-like) and an ultra narrowband (Sigfox-like) network will be explained and evaluated. On the physical layer, simulation results show that an ultra narrowband network has a larger coverage, while wideband spread spectrum networks are less sensitive to interference. When considering the contention between nodes and interference between different networks, simulations show that adaptation of frequency and modulation is imperative for efficiently dealing with varying contention and interference in long range unlicensed networks. Depending on network load, size and distance, a device in a wideband network can send 6 times more packets to the base station when there is active rate and frequency management and an intra-technology control plane.},
  annotation = {\textbackslash{}citet\{reynders\_range\_2016\} evaluated Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) and ultra-narrow-band networks.\\
They proposed a heuristic equation that gives Bit Error Rate (BER) for a CSS modulation as a function of SF and Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR).

In \textbackslash{}cite\{reynders\_range\_2016\},\\
the performances in terms of packet delivery ratio and throughput of LoRaWAN R

However,\\
the simulation process and the numerous network parameters are not exposed enough thus lacking of transparency and possibility of reuse.

\textbackslash{}citet\{reynders\_range\_2016\} compared the performance of LoRa and Ultra Narrowband (UNB,\\
SIGFOX-like) networks with regard to the range and coexistence.\\
They showed that UNB MAC is slightly better than LoRaWAN:\\
the latter discards both colliding packets at reception,\\
while the UNB network enables reception of the strongest packet thanks to the capture effect.\\
The maximal throughput of the network occurs for 10 5 devices in the network,\\
but results in a packet loss of 63\textbackslash\%.

  abstract = {Network slicing is a fundamental capability for future 5G networks to properly support current and envisioned future application scenarios. Network slicing facilitates a cost-effective deployment and operation of multiple logical networks over a common physical network infrastructure such that each network is customized to best serve the needs of specific applications (e.g., mobile broadband, Internet of Things applications) and/or communications service providers (e.g., special purpose service providers for different sectors such as public safety, utilities, smart city, and automobiles). Slicing a RAN becomes particularly challenging due to the inherently shared nature of the radio channel and the potential influence that any transmitter may have on any receiver. In this respect, this article analyzes the RAN slicing problem in a multi-cell network in relation to the RRM functionalities that can be used as a support for splitting the radio resources among the RAN slices. Four different RAN slicing approaches are presented and compared from different perspectives, such as the granularity in the assignment of radio resources and the degrees of isolation and customization.},

This paper presents the ongoing mobile network evolution towards 5G, with a focus on the emerging network slicing concept, supposed to cope with the disparate requirements of future services and applications. Network slicing allows for the coexistence of different architectures to address disparate service requirements in a more efficient way. A slice selection function is a key element in the future core network architecture, enabling the UE to be allocated to a proper slice. We proposed a new slice selection mechanism allowing the UE to connect to multiple slices based on service type.

  abstract = {New verticals within the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm such as smart cities, smart farming, or goods monitoring, among many others, are demanding strong requirements to the Radio Access Network (RAN) in terms of coverage, end-node's power consumption, and scalability. The technologies employed so far to provide IoT scenarios with connectivity, e.g., wireless sensor network and cellular technologies, are not able to simultaneously cope with these three requirements. Thus, a novel solution known as Low Power - Wide Area Network (LP-WAN) has emerged as a promising alternative to provide with low-cost and low-power-consumption connectivity to end-nodes spread in a wide area. Concretely, the Long-Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) technology is one of the LP-WAN platforms that is receiving greater attention from both the industry and the academia. For that reason, in this work, a comprehensive performance evaluation of LoRaWAN under different environmental conditions is presented. The results are obtained from three real scenarios, namely, urban, suburban, and rural, considering both dynamic and static conditions, hence a discussion about the most proper LoRaWAN physical-layer configuration for each scenario is provided. Besides, a theoretical coverage study is also conducted by the use of a radio planning tool considering topographic maps and a precise propagation model. From the attained results, it can be concluded that it is necessary to evaluate the propagation conditions of the deployment scenario prior to the system implantation in order to reach a compromise between the robustness of the network and the transmission data-rate.},

However, the stringent regulations on the usage of certain ISM (Industrial, Scientific and Medical) bands in many countries in which LPWAN operate limit the amount of time IoT motes can occupy the shared bands. This is particularly challenging in industrial scenarios, where not being able to report some detected events might result in the failure of critical assets. To alleviate this, and by mathematically modeling LPWAN-based IoT motes, we have derived optimal transmission policies that maximize the number of reported events (prioritized by their importance) while still complying with current regulations. The proposed solution has been customized for two widely known LPWAN technologies: LoRa and Sigfox. Analytical results reveal that our solution is feasible and performs remarkably close to the Theoretical Limit for a wide range of network activity patterns.},

  abstract = {Recently released 5G networks empower the novel Network Slicing concept. Network slicing introduces new business models such as allowing telecom providers to lease a virtualized slice of their infrastructure to tenants such as industry verticals, e.g. automotive, e-health, factories, etc. However, this new paradigm poses a major challenge when applied to Radio Access Networks (RAN): how to achieve revenue maximization while meeting the diverse service level agreements (SLAs) requested by the infrastructure tenants? In this paper, we propose a new analytical framework, based on stochastic geometry theory, to model realistic RANs that leverage the business opportunities offered by network slicing. We mathematically prove the benefits of slicing radio access networks as compared to non-sliced infrastructures. Based on this, we design a new admission control functional block, STORNS, which takes decisions considering per slice SLA guaranteed average experienced throughput. A radio resource allocation strategy is introduced to optimally allocate transmit power and bandwidth (i.e., a slice of radio access resources) to the users of each infrastructure tenant. Numerical results are illustrated to validate our proposed solution in terms of potential spectral efficiency, and compare it against a non-slicing benchmark.},

  abstract = {Tactile Internet (TI) will generate a variety of 5G-enabled use cases with different requirements for latency, throughput and reliability. In this paper, we propose a flexible cloud-based radio access network (FRAN) for TI, where traffic of user equipments (UEs) can be temporary offloaded from the operator-provided networks to user-provided networks if needed. Such a concept enables dynamic network slicing (DNS) where the network architecture is temporally augmented with slices of infrastructure borrowed from user provided network. FRAN is able to support Tactile applications without any basic change to the hardware/software infrastructure in the network. We model DNS system as a two-layer/slice traffic-aware resource allocation framework, where every layer uses a separate two-step matching game in order to serve Tactile users (TUs) and low-priority users (LUs). We propose a subgame Nash stable and two-sided exchange stable concepts as solutions of the proposed two-layer traffic-aware resource allocation. Our numerical results show that network operators and UEs (either TUs or LUs) significantly benefit from deploying the FRAN rather than conventional cloudbased radio access networks (CRANs).},

Selection of an appropriate transmission rate plays a significant role in determining the overall efficiency of a communication system. The technique which determines the channel state information and accordingly selects an appropriate transmission rate is called rate-adaptation protocol. The IEEE 802.11 standard does not provide standard specification for implementing a rate-adaptation protocol for its multi-rate capable wireless stations. Due to the lack of standard specification, there is a myriad of rate-adaptation protocols, proposed by industry and various research institutes. This paper surveys the existing rate-adaptation schemes, discusses various features which contribute significantly in the process of rate-adaptation, the timing constraints on such schemes, and the performance gains in terms of throughput, delay and energy efficiency; which can be gained by the use of rate-adaptation. The paper also discusses the implication of rate-adaptation schemes on the performance of overall communication and identifies existing research challenges in the design of rate-adaptation schemes.},

  abstract = {Large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) deployments demand long-range wireless communications, especially in urban and metropolitan areas. LoRa is one of the most promising technologies in this context due to its simplicity and flexibility. Indeed, deploying LoRa networks in dense IoT scenarios must achieve two main goals: efficient communications among a large number of devices and resilience against dynamic channel conditions due to demanding environmental settings (e.g., the presence of many buildings). This work investigates adaptive mechanisms to configure the communication parameters of LoRa networks in dense IoT scenarios. To this end, we develop FLoRa, an open-source framework for end-to-end LoRa simulations in OMNeT++. We then implement and evaluate the Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) mechanism built into LoRa to dynamically manage link parameters for scalable and efficient network operations. Extensive simulations show that ADR is effective in increasing the network delivery ratio under stable channel conditions, while keeping the energy consumption low. Our results also show that the performance of ADR is severely affected by a highly-varying wireless channel. We thereby propose an improved version of the original ADR mechanism to cope with variable channel conditions. Our proposed solution significantly increases both the reliability and the energy efficiency of communications over a noisy channel, almost irrespective of the network size. Finally, we show that the delivery ratio of very dense networks can be further improved by using a network-aware approach, wherein the link parameters are configured based on the global knowledge of the network.},

More and more vertical industries need their machines and devices connected in networks with specific requirements. In order to provide networks fitted to these usecases, and not require that they adapt to the one-size-fits-all network as is currently the case with the mobile Internet, the telecom community vowed to include network slicing functionality within its next generation of mobile networking, 5G, as an end-to-end network solution. As the concept is new and still not fully grasped, we develop and refine the concept of a network slice both from a business and a technological point of view. We investigate how network slicing in the context of a vehicular network could be implemented and how it advances the state of the art. This involves a detailed study of the involved technologies across a range of infrastructures and network segments, as well as the resulting gaps in the existing technology landscape. Based on the lessons learned in this concrete usecase, network slicing is considered in a broader 5G landscape. We capture the main challenges and potential directions in order to make network slicing a true enabler of 5G-driven vertical industries.},

However, due to the introduction of NS into radio access networks (RAN) forming a UE-BS-NS three-layer association, handoff becomes very complicated and cannot be resolved by conventional policies. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement LEarning based Smart handoff policy with data Sharing, named LESS, to reduce handoff cost while maintaining user QoS requirements in RAN slicing. Considering the large action space introduced by multiple users and the data sparsity problem due to user mobility, LESS is designed to have two components: 1) LESS-DL, a modified distributed Q-learning algorithm with small action space to make handoff decisions; 2) LESS-DS, a data sharing mechanism using limited data to improve the accuracy of handoff decisions made by LESS-DL. The proposed LESS mechanism uses LESS-DL to choose both the target base station and NS when a handoff occurs, and then updates the Q-values of each user according to LESS-DS. Numerical results show that in typical scenarios, LESS can significantly reduce the handoff cost when compared with traditional handoff policies without learning.},

However, with the number of user equipments (UEs) fast increasing, the centralized resource allocation architecture for network slicing can put heavy burdens on the global radio resource manager (GRRM), and meanwhile slice customization is not easy to achieve. To overcome the two issues, a hierarchical radio resource allocation architecture is proposed in this paper, where the GRRM is responsible for allocating subchannels to local radio resource managers (LRRMs) in slices, which then allocate the assigned resources to their UEs. Under this architecture, a hierarchical resource allocation problem is formulated, and the problem is further modeled as a Stakelberg game with the GRRM as the leader and LRRMs as followers, considering the hierarchy between the GRRM and LRRMs. Due to the NP-hardness of the followers' problems, a process based on exhaustive search is first proposed to achieve the Stackelberg equilibrium (SE). Nevertheless, when the network scale is large, achieving SE within limited decision making time is impractical for game players. Facing this challenge, the GRRM and LRRMs are seen as bounded rational players, and low complexity algorithms are developed to help them achieve local optimal solutions that lead to a weak version of SE. Simulation results show that there exists a tradeoff between the performance of slices, and the low complexity algorithms achieve close performance to that of exhaustive search and outperform other baselines significantly.},

On the other hand, fog radio access network (F-RAN) has emerged as a promising network architecture to satisfy different QoS requirements in distinct application scenarios. To make the network slicing work more efficiently, a downlink F-RAN, equipped with a ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) slice and an enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) slice logically, is concerned in this paper. A delayaware resource allocation optimization problem is formulated, aiming to maximize the throughput of the eMBB slice as well as guarantee the queuing delay performance of the URLLC slice. The delay-aware optimization problem is reformulated as a perslot joint resource block (RB) and power allocation problem, which is addressed by Lagrange dual decomposition method. Simulation results show a tradeoff between the throughput and the queuing delay of eMBB slice can be achieved while satisfying the delay constraint of URLLC slice.},

However, the resource management for network slices is challenging, especially when the edge caching is utilized to alleviate the fronthaul burden and reduce the delay. In this paper, we investigate the joint sub-carrier allocation and caching placement for two network slices, and an average delay optimization problem for one slice with user data rate guarantee for the other slice is formulated, which can be solved by a two-step iterative algorithm.

To validate the module, we compare its results with measurements on a real-world testbed and with measured values reported by other work. We also show that the module correctly represents the capture effect that lowers the packet drop rate due to collisions. Second, we want to improve the performance of LoRa devices while not impacting energy consumption, the aspect that usually is not taken into account in the literature. We use the simulator to evaluate CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access), a simple enhancement to LoRaWAN that lowers the collision ratio. The simulation results show that CSMA considerably lowers the collision ratio while only slightly increasing energy consumption. We also observe that CSMA presents lower energy consumption than LoRa for a large number of devices. Another advantage of CSMA consists of increased throughput and larger network capacity because the ETSI restrictions on the duty cycle do not longer apply.},

  abstract = {Wireless network slicing (i.e., network virtualization) is one of the potential technologies for addressing the issue of rapidly growing demand in mobile data services related to 5G cellular networks. It logically decouples the current cellular networks into two entities; infrastructure providers (InPs) and mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs). The resources of base stations (e.g., resource blocks, transmission power, antennas) which are owned by the InP are shared to multiple MVNOs who need resources for their mobile users. Specifically, the physical resources of an InP are abstracted into multiple isolated network slices, which are then allocated to MVNO's mobile users. In this paper, two-level allocation problem in network slicing is examined, whilst enabling efficient resource utilization, interslice isolation (i.e., no interference amongst slices), and intraslice isolation (i.e., no interference between users in the same slice). A generalized Kelly mechanism (GKM) is also designed, based on which the upper level of the resource allocation issue (i.e., between the InP and MVNOs) is addressed. The benefit of using such a resource bidding and allocation framework is that the seller (InP) does not need to know the true valuation of the bidders (MVNOs). For solving the lower level of resource allocation issue (i.e., between MVNOs and their mobile users), the optimal resource allocation is derived from each MVNO to its mobile users by using KKT conditions. Then, bandwidth resources are allocated to the users of MVNOs. Finally, the results of simulation are presented to verify the theoretical analysis of our proposed two-level resource allocation problem in wireless network slicing.},

  abstract = {Long Range (LoRa) is a popular technology used to construct Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) networks. Given the popularity of LoRa it is likely that multiple independent LoRa networks are deployed in close proximity. In this situation, neighbouring networks interfere and methods have to be found to combat this interference. In this paper we investigate the use of directional antennae and the use of multiple base stations as methods of dealing with inter-network interference. Directional antennae increase signal strength at receivers without increasing transmission energy cost. Thus, the probability of successfully decoding the message in an interference situation is improved. Multiple base stations can alternatively be used to improve the probability of receiving a message in a noisy environment. We compare the effectiveness of these two approaches via simulation. Our findings show that both methods are able to improve LoRa network performance in interference settings. However, the results show that the use of multiple base stations clearly outperforms the use of directional antennae. For example, in a setting where data is collected from 600 nodes which are interfered by four networks with 600 nodes each, using three base stations improves the Data Extraction Rate (DER) from 0.24 to 0.56 while the use of directional antennae provides an increase to only 0.32.},

  abstract = {Network slicing is designed to support a variety of emerging applications with diverse performance and flexibility requirements, by dividing the physical network into multiple logical networks. These applications along with a massive number of mobile phones produce large amounts of data, bringing tremendous challenges for network slicing performance. From another perspective, this huge amount of data also offers a new opportunity for the management of network slicing resources. Leveraging the knowledge and insights retrieved from the data, we develop a novel Machine Learning-based scheme for dynamic resource scheduling for networks slicing, aiming to achieve automatic and efficient resource optimisation and End-to-End (E2E) service reliability. However, it is difficult to obtain the userrelated data, which is crucial to understand the user behaviour and requests, due to the privacy issue. Therefore, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is leveraged to extract knowledge from experience by interacting with the network and enable dynamic adjustment of the resources allocated to various slices in order to maximise the resource utilisation while guaranteeing the Quality-of-Service (QoS). The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed resource scheduling scheme can dynamically allocate resources for multiple slices and meet the corresponding QoS requirements.},

  abstract = {The diversified usage scenarios of 5G networks require to allocate communication-computing-caching (3C) multidimensional resources efficiently according to different service requirement in terms of latency, bandwidth, and connectivity. In this paper, a network slicing (NS) architecture based mobile edge computing (MEC) and software-defined network (SDN) technologies are proposed to support flexible 3C resource allocation for improving the service of three 5G typical usage scenarios, namely enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra-reliable and low latency communications (URLLC) and massive machine-type communications (mMTC). Furthermore, a neural network (NN) based 3C resource allocation algorithm is designed to provide resource allocation decision for the NS architecture. With the aid of data pre-processing techniques, fast resource allocation decisions can be made by the NN aided NS architecture. Meanwhile, the performance of the proposed NS architecture is investigated in a testbed environment. Experimental results obtained from the testbed demonstrate that the system performance of the NN aided NS architecture can be improved by function fitting based pre-processing approaches. Moreover, an accurate classification performance can be obtained by the proposed architecture for facilitating 3C resource allocations.},

The existing works on network slicing are mainly targeted at the partition of the core network, and the prospect of network slicing in radio access networks should be jointly exploited. To solve this challenge, enhanced network slicing in F-RANs, called access slicing, is proposed. This article comprehensively presents a novel architecture and related key techniques for access slicing in F-RANs. The proposed hierarchical architecture of access slicing consists of a centralized orchestration layer and a slice instance layer, which makes access slicing adaptively implementable in a convenient way. Meanwhile, key techniques and their corresponding solutions, including radio and cache resource management as well as social-aware slicing, are presented. Open issues in terms of standardization developments and field trials are identified.},

  abstract = {The proliferation of mobile demands and increasingly multifarious services pose challenges to both the radio access networks (RANs) and the core network (CN). Unfortunately, the traditional networks can hardly meet the increasing requirements. Software-defined network (SDN) and network virtualization (NV) are considered as innovative paradigms to stress these problems. By extending SDN to wireless networks, software-defined wireless network (SDWN) consisting of both RANs and CN can be obtained. In this paper, the RANs and CN of SDWN are virtualized to virtual access points (VAPs) and network slices respectively based on NV technology. Considering the system scenario that a SDWN consists of overlapping RANs, an optimal joint YAP and network slice selection scheme is proposed. To characterize the complicated transmission performance of YAPs and network slices, the concepts of utility function and network calculus are introduced, and the joint utility of YAPs and network slices is formulated based on which the optimal YAP and network slice combination corresponding to the maximal joint utility can be selected. The simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract = {It is widely acknowledged that network slicing can tackle the diverse use cases and connectivity services of the forthcoming next-generation mobile networks (5G). Resource scheduling is of vital importance for improving resourcemultiplexing gain among slices while meeting specific service requirements for radio access network (RAN) slicing. Unfortunately, due to the performance isolation, diversified service requirements, and network dynamics (including user mobility and channel states), resource scheduling in RAN slicing is very challenging. In this paper, we propose an intelligent resource scheduling strategy (iRSS) for 5G RAN slicing. The main idea of an iRSS is to exploit a collaborative learning framework that consists of deep learning (DL) in conjunction with reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, DL is used to perform large time-scale resource allocation, whereas RL is used to perform online resource scheduling for tackling small time-scale network dynamics, including inaccurate prediction and unexpected network states. Depending on the amount of available historical traffic data, an iRSS can flexibly adjust the significance between the prediction and online decision modules for assisting RAN in making resource scheduling decisions. Numerical results show that the convergence of an iRSS satisfies online resource scheduling requirements and can significantly improve resource utilization while guaranteeing performance isolation between slices, compared with other benchmark algorithms.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a dynamic radio resource slicing framework is presented for a two-tier heterogeneous wireless network (HetNet). Through software-defined networking (SDN)enabled wireless network function virtualization (NFV), radio spectrum resources of heterogeneous wireless networks are partitioned into different bandwidth slices for different base stations (BSs). This framework facilitates spectrum sharing among heterogeneous BSs and achieves differentiated quality-of-service (QoS) provisioning for data service and machine-to-machine (M2M) service in the presence of network load dynamics. To determine the set of optimal bandwidth slicing ratios and optimal BS-device association patterns, a network utility maximization problem is formulated with the consideration of different traffic statistics and QoS requirements, location distribution for end devices, varying device locations, load conditions in each cell, and inter-cell interference. For tractability, the optimization problem is transformed to a biconcave maximization problem. An alternative concave search (ACS) algorithm is then designed to solve for a set of partial optimal solutions. Simulation results verify the convergence property and display low complexity of the ACS algorithm. It is demonstrated that the proposed radio resource slicing framework outperforms the two other resource slicing schemes in terms of low communication overhead, high spectrum utilization, and high aggregate network utility.},

  abstract = {Long Range (LoRa) has become one of the most popular Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) technologies, which provides a desirable trade-off among communication range, battery life, and deployment cost. In LoRa networks, several transmission parameters can be allocated to ensure efficient and reliable communication. For example, the configuration of the spreading factor allows tuning the data rate and the transmission distance. However, how to dynamically adjust the setting that minimizes the collision probability while meeting the required communication performance is an open challenge. This paper proposes a novel Data Rate and Channel Control (DRCC) scheme for LoRa networks so as to improve wireless resource utilization and support a massive number of LoRa nodes. The scheme estimates channel conditions based on the short-term Data Extraction Rate (DER), and opportunistically adjusts the spreading factor to adapt the variation of channel conditions. Furthermore, the channel control is carried out to balance the link load of all available channels with the global information of the channel usage, which is able to lower the access collisions under dense deployments. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed DRCC performs well on improving the reliability and capacity compared with other spreading factor allocation schemes in dense deployment scenarios.},

  abstract = {LoRa is a low-power long-range IoT standard that uses the chirp spread spectrum technique, and we have strived to further extend its coverage by utilizing the direct device-to-device (D2D) links to construct a multi-hop relay network. In LoRa, the spreading factor (SF) is an important parameter, which not only provides great flexibility between the data rate and sensitivity but also presents a new dimension for multiple accesses. Our approach to improving the capacity of a multihop LoRa network is to attempt to off-load the data traffic into several subnets by utilizing this multiple-access dimension. Each subnet rooted at a sink node is allocated a specific SF on the basis of network clustering. This enables packet transmission in parallel with multiple SFs to become feasible. To allow such parallel transmissions, our considerations are: 1) ensuring the connectivity of all subnets; 2) off-loading the traffic according to the number of nodes, data rates, and network topologies of each subnet; and 3) shortening the airtime of each subnet by reducing the hop count. Toward these objectives, we present a tree-based SF clustering algorithm (TSCA) to conduct SF allocation in a multihop LoRa network. The TSCA focuses on balancing the airtime between the subnets while ensuring connectivity. Furthermore, we use simulations to show that our approach can significantly increase the network performance compared with other approaches. We additionally deploy a real-chip experiment to evaluate the feasibility of parallel transmission in practice.},

  abstract = {LoRa networks enable long range communications for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. The current LoRa technology provides a wide range of communication settings whereas many combination settings are orthogonal and, thus, they can be successfully decoded at the gateway when the signals are transmitted simultaneously. Previous simulation results showed that the LoRa network capacity can be improved when multiple communication parameters are applied. In this paper, we model a LoRa network consisting of nodes with different communication settings in terms of bandwidth and spreading factor. We compute the average success probability per configuration as a function of density taking into account both intra and inter-spreading factor collisions. We, also, formulate and solve an optimization problem to maximize the node capacity for a given deployment area and frequency by optimizing the number of nodes having different spreading factor configurations. We present numerical results and we show that solutions close to the optimal can increase the maximum number of nodes by more than 700\% compared to case where equal number of users per spreading factor are considered.},
