  abstract = {Device-to-device (D2D) communication presents a new paradigm in mobile networking to facilitate data exchange between physically proximate devices. The development of D2D is driven by mobile operators to harvest short range communications for improving network performance and supporting proximity-based services. In this paper, we investigate two fundamental and interrelated aspects of D2D communication, security and privacy, which are essential for the adoption and deployment of D2D. We present an extensive review of the state-of-the-art solutions for enhancing security and privacy in D2D communication. By summarizing the challenges, requirements, and features of different proposals, we identify lessons to be learned from existing studies and derive a set of ``best practices.'' The primary goal of our work is to equip researchers and developers with a better understanding of the underlying problems and the potential solutions for D2D security and privacy. To inspire follow-up research, we identify open problems and highlight future directions with regard to system and communication design. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive review to address the fundamental security and privacy issues in D2D communication.},

  abstract = {As the deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) is experiencing an exponential growth, it is no surprise that many recent cyber attacks are IoT-enabled: The attacker initially exploits some vulnerable IoT technology as a first step towards compromising a critical system that is connected, in some way, with the IoT. For some sectors, like industry, smart grids, transportation and medical services, the significance of such attacks is obvious, since IoT technologies are part of critical back-end systems. However, in sectors where IoT is usually at the end-user side, like smart homes, such attacks can be underestimated, since not all possible attack paths are examined. In this paper we survey IoT-enabled cyber attacks, found in all application domains since 2010. For each sector, we emphasize on the latest, verified IoT-enabled attacks, based on known real-world incidents and published proof-of-concept attacks. We methodologically analyze representative attacks that demonstrate direct, indirect and subliminal attack paths against critical targets. Our goal is threefold: (i) To assess IoT-enabled cyber attacks in a risk-like approach, in order to demonstrate their current threat landscape; (ii) To identify hidden and subliminal IoT-enabled attack paths against critical infrastructures and services, and (iii) To examine mitigation strategies for all application domains.},

These networks need to be able to offer services at high quality levels for a massive amount of users and smart objects. In this paper, we analyse the Quality of Service (QoS) of our Relay and Mobility Scheme for the Internet of Things (REMOS-IOT), which consists of IoT objects that provide several services such as video applications, CCTV monitoring and sensor data, smart gateways, which interconnect the smart devices, and a cloud-deployed platform which is used for resource management and decision-making to improve network quality. This paper presents a novel algorithm which considers QoS, devices locations and service relevance metrics and creates more appropriate clusters for the networked IoT objects in order to improve IoT services quality. Objects are then attached to gateways or relay devices with better network quality, while the performance of poorly operating clusters is also improved.},

  abstract = {This paper provides an overview of the Internet of Things (IoT) with emphasis on enabling technologies, protocols, and application issues. The IoT is enabled by the latest developments in RFID, smart sensors, communication technologies, and Internet protocols. The basic premise is to have smart sensors collaborate directly without human involvement to deliver a new class of applications. The current revolution in Internet, mobile, and machine-to-machine (M2M) technologies can be seen as the first phase of the IoT. In the coming years, the IoT is expected to bridge diverse technologies to enable new applications by connecting physical objects together in support of intelligent decision making. This paper starts by providing a horizontal overview of the IoT. Then, we give an overview of some technical details that pertain to the IoT enabling technologies, protocols, and applications. Compared to other survey papers in the field, our objective is to provide a more thorough summary of the most relevant protocols and application issues to enable researchers and application developers to get up to speed quickly on how the different protocols fit together to deliver desired functionalities without having to go through RFCs and the standards specifications. We also provide an overview of some of the key IoT challenges presented in the recent literature and provide a summary of related research work. Moreover, we explore the relation between the IoT and other emerging technologies including big data analytics and cloud and fog computing. We also present the need for better horizontal integration among IoT services. Finally, we present detailed service use-cases to illustrate how the different protocols presented in the paper fit together to deliver desired IoT services.},

  abstract = {While Twitter and other Online Social Networks (OSNs) or microblogs are considered as a source of information for breaking news or uproarious and unexpected events, they could also be exploited as a dense worldwide sensors network for physical measurements. The corpus of geotagged posts from OSNs includes people's feedbacks about a wide range of topics, with precise temporal and geographical metadata, that can be used as a support or an improvement to hardware sensors. For instance, if collocated people, independently and at the same time, write posts complaining about high temperatures, it could effectively denote a raise of heat in that place. In this paper, we explore the feasibility to use a geographical search on social networks, that is, a geosocial search, about air pollution related posts, as effective air impureness measurements. We evaluate our assumption in large cities over three continents of the planet, where a minimum increment about the number of air pollution related posts in an area, indeed corresponds to a raise of minimum pollution values in such area. Such a correlation can be exploited to integrate and extend existing air pollution monitoring networks. At the end of the manuscript we propose to further employ the time series of posts returned by the geosocial search to predict next pollution values.},

Market research has shown a significant growth of sensor deployments over the past decade and has predicted a significant increment of the growth rate in the future. These sensors continuously generate enormous amounts of data. However, in order to add value to raw sensor data we need to understand it. Collection, modelling, reasoning, and distribution of context in relation to sensor data plays critical role in this challenge. Context-aware computing has proven to be successful in understanding sensor data. In this paper, we survey context awareness from an IoT perspective. We present the necessary background by introducing the IoT paradigm and context-aware fundamentals at the beginning. Then we provide an in-depth analysis of context life cycle. We evaluate a subset of projects (50) which represent the majority of research and commercial solutions proposed in the field of context-aware computing conducted over the last decade (2001-2011) based on our own taxonomy. Finally, based on our evaluation, we highlight the lessons to be learnt from the past and some possible directions for future research. The survey addresses a broad range of techniques, methods, models, functionalities, systems, applications, and middleware solutions related to context awareness and IoT. Our goal is not only to analyse, compare and consolidate past research work but also to appreciate their findings and discuss their applicability towards the IoT.},

  abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is part of Future Internet and will comprise many billions of Internet Connected Objects (ICO) or `things' where things can sense, communicate, compute and potentially actuate as well as have intelligence, multi-modal interfaces, physical/ virtual identities and attributes. Collecting data from these objects is an important task as it allows software systems to understand the environment better. Many different hardware devices may involve in the process of collecting and uploading sensor data to the cloud where complex processing can occur. Further, we cannot expect all these objects to be connected to the computers due to technical and economical reasons. Therefore, we should be able to utilize resource constrained devices to collect data from these ICOs. On the other hand, it is critical to process the collected sensor data before sending them to the cloud to make sure the sustainability of the infrastructure due to energy constraints. This requires to move the sensor data processing tasks towards the resource constrained computational devices (e.g. mobile phones). In this paper, we propose Mobile Sensor Data Processing Engine (MOSDEN), an plug-in-based IoT middleware for mobile devices, that allows to collect and process sensor data without programming efforts. Our architecture also supports sensing as a service model. We present the results of the evaluations that demonstrate its suitability towards real world deployments. Our proposed middleware is built on Android platform.},

In this paper, we propose an urban road user classification framework using local feature descriptors and hidden Markov models (HMM). Our framework achieved pedestrians, bicyclists, motorcyclist classification in high ac\- curacy. The framework consists of two classification meth\- ods: pedestrian-bicyclist classification and bicyclist-motorcyclist classification. First, we discriminate between pedestrians and bicyclist-like objects using histograms of oriented gradients (HOG)-based classifiers. We implemented a cascade classifier using generic HOG and our original local feature descrip\- tor called co-occurrence semantic HOG. Bicyclist-like objects mainly consist of bicyclists and motorcyclists. We focused on the objects' leg motions and classify them using the hidden Markov models (HMM)-based motion models. We conducted experiments with real traffic scenes to evaluate the performance of our framework. The experiments for pedestrian-bicyclist classification and bicyclist-motorcyclist classification are con\- ducted independently and both methods achieve nearly 90\% on classification.},

  abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging technology that aims to connect our environment to the internet in the same way that personal computers connected people. As this technology progresses, the IoT paradigm becomes more prevalent in our everyday lives. The nature of IoT applications necessitates devices that are low-cost, power-sensitive, integrated, unobtrusive, and interoperable with existing cloud platforms and services, for example, Amazon AWS IoT, IBM Watson IoT. As a result, these devices are often small in size, with just enough computing power needed for their specific tasks. These resource-constrained devices are often unable to implement traditional network security measures and represent a vulnerability to network attackers as a result. Few frameworks are positioned to handle the influx of this new technology and the security concerns associated with it. Current solutions fail to provide a comprehensive and multilayer solution to these inherent IoT security vulnerabilities. This paper presents a layered approach to IoT testbed that aims to bridge multiple connection standards and cloud platforms. To solve challenges surrounding this multi-layer IoT testbed, we propose a mesh inside a mesh IoT network architecture. Our designed ``edge router'' incorporates two mesh networks together and performs seamlessly transmission of multi-standard packets. The proposed IoT testbed interoperates with existing multi-standards (Wi-Fi, 6LoWPAN) and segments of networks, and provides both Internet and resilient sensor coverage to the cloud platform. To ensure confidentiality and authentication of IoT devices when interoperating with multiple service platforms, we propose optimized cryptographic techniques and software frameworks for IoT devices. We propose to extend and modify the existing open-source IDS platforms such as Snort to support IoT platforms and environments. We validate the efficacy of the proposed system by evaluating its performance and effect on key system resources. The work within this testbed design and implementation provides a solid foundation for further IoT system development.},

This causes difficulties in areas with poor Internet access, such as remote rural areas, or challenging radio environments, for example in metropolitan areas, as the LoRa gateway must be placed at a location with backhaul access to the network server, but must nonetheless be reachable by all end devices. To facilitate these applications, we present a new routing protocol to enable mesh networking with LoRa, allowing for multihop networking between gateways to extend coverage. Our protocol is tailored specifically to the requirements of LoRa networks. We have developed a proof-of-concept implementation of the protocol and have shown its effectiveness in both laboratory tests and a field trial in a real-world LoRa deployment.},

As a result, it is difficult to determine a univocal architecture to identify as a reference and several scenarios, involving different sensors, smart devices, networks or gateways, can unfold. The data exchanged within and among IoT frameworks are growing exponentially, and the pervasiveness of such systems brings them to come in possession of very sensitive information: as a consequence, Security and Privacy have become a hot topic on the IoT scenery. Furthermore, due to the great variety of technological solutions which are currently available, interoperability issues are bound to arise, especially when no standard API interface, or communication protocol, has been officially adopted.},

This paper explains the motivation behind the integration of these two techniques, and highlights certain scenarios in which the joint approach may even degrade the performance, emphasizing the fact that their synergistic effect cannot be accomplished with a naive and perfunctory combination. This survey paper also provides a comprehensive taxonomy of the joint protocols in terms of their fundamental components and associated challenges, and compares existing joint protocols.

With the advantage of distributed architecture and close to end-users, fog/edge computing can provide faster response and greater quality of service for IoT applications. Thus, fog/edge computing-based IoT becomes future infrastructure on IoT development. To develop fog/edge computing-based IoT infrastructure, the architecture, enabling techniques, and issues related to IoT should be investigated first, and then the integration of fog/edge computing and IoT should be explored. To this end, this paper conducts a comprehensive overview of IoT with respect to system architecture, enabling technologies, security and privacy issues, and present the integration of fog/edge computing and IoT, and applications. Particularly, this paper first explores the relationship between cyber-physical systems and IoT, both of which play important roles in realizing an intelligent cyber-physical world. Then, existing architectures, enabling technologies, and security and privacy issues in IoT are presented to enhance the understanding of the state of the art IoT development. To investigate the fog/edge computing-based IoT, this paper also investigate the relationship between IoT and fog/edge computing, and discuss issues in fog/edge computing-based IoT. Finally, several applications, including the smart grid, smart transportation, and smart cities, are presented to demonstrate how fog/edge computing-based IoT to be implemented in real-world applications.},

  abstract = {In the last few years, many smart objects found in the physical world are interconnected and communicate through the existing internet infrastructure which creates a global network infrastructure called the Internet of Things (IoT). Research has shown a substantial development of solutions for a wide range of devices and IoT platforms over the past 6-7 years. However, each solution provides its own IoT infrastructure, devices, APIs, and data formats leading to interoperability issues. Such interoperability issues are the consequence of many critical issues such as vendor lock-in, impossibility to develop IoT application exposing cross-platform, and/or cross-domain, difficulty in plugging non-interoperable IoT devices into different IoT platforms, and ultimately prevents the emergence of IoT technology at a large-scale. To enable seamless resource sharing between different IoT vendors, efforts by several academia, industry, and standardization bodies have emerged to help IoT interoperability, i.e., the ability for multiple IoT platforms from different vendors to work together. This paper performs a comprehensive survey on the state-of-the-art solutions for facilitating interoperability between different IoT platforms. Also, the key challenges in this topic is presented.},

  abstract = {In the near future, all our everyday things and objects will be both connected to the Internet and equipped with enough sensing, acting and processing capabilities to exploit the full potential benefits of the so called Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. Even the simplest objects will become ``smart'' because they will be interconnected to other objects to share and collect data from the environments in which they are placed thus paving the way to novel application services, computing and communication scenarios. In this context, interoperability among different standards and communication technologies is still a significant challenge that we have started to address by proposing a smartphone-based mobile gateway acting as a flexible and transparent interface between different IoT devices and the Internet. The presented unified, high-level and extendible software architecture supports opportunistic IoT devices discovery, control and management coupled with data processing, collection and diffusion functionalities. A specific testbed on common smartphones with different hardware and software capabilities was deployed to evaluate the real feasibility of the designed solution measuring the system performance in terms of energy consumption, memory and CPU usage in high and low load scenarios. According to the obtained results, the implemented software architecture for multi-standard and multi-technology interoperation presents a reduced use of hardware resources in front of a relatively high energy consumption value, mostly due to the simultaneously active radio interfaces combined with a small battery capacity, that limits the smartphone lifetime. Nevertheless, the presented general approach is still remarkable because this latter aspect will most likely be exceeded, in a short time, thanks to daily technological advancements in both batteries and radio interfaces.},

Quite recently a number of attempts have been made towards an optimal resource management using various scheduling schemes. This paper broadly divides these scheduling schemes into three aspects, namely Quality of Services (QoS), IoT architecture, and IoT network infrastructure. The paper also presents an analysis based on different metrics of IoT resource scheduling and a comparison among different resource scheduling techniques. A section of this analysis is dedicated to the simulation model analyses involved in different scheduling schemes. Finally, we believe there is still a lot of scope in improving IoT resource management maintaining the overall quality needed.

The problem consists in the selection of the most suitable from all radio access technologies available. The decision process is called network selection, and depends on several parameters, such as quality of service, mobility, cost, energy, battery life, etc. Several methods and approaches have been proposed in this context, with their objective being to offer the best QoS to the users, and/or to maximize re-usability of the networks. This paper represents a survey of the network selection methods used. Multiple attribute-dependent decision-making methods are presented. Furthermore, the game theory concept is illustrated, the use of the fuzzy logic is presented, and the utility functions defining the network selection process are discussed.},

In fact, a large number of devices may attempt simultaneously to access the base station, which may result in severe congestions at the random-access channel (RACH) level. To alleviate such congestion while regulating the M2M devices' opportunities to transmit, the Access Class Barring (ACB) process was proposed. In this article, we propose a novel implementation of the ACB mechanism in the context of multiple M2M traffic classes. Based on a scheduling algorithm, we have applied a PID controller to adjust dynamically multiple ACB factors related to each class category, guaranteeing a number of devices around an optimal value that maximizes the Random Access (RA) success probability. The obtained results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed mechanism by increasing the success probability and minimizing radio resources' underutilization with respect to each class priority.},

  abstract = {The next mobile generation is planned to create a networked society, in which Machine-to-machine (M2M) communications are expected to play a key role in a plethora of domains and applications. The massive deployment of such devices may overwhelm the cellular network by imposing strong constraints on the Radio Access Network (RAN) because of the radio resources' scarcity. As the base station cannot accurately get the exact number of M2M arrivals, it cannot really predict the overload status, which limits any control action. Consequently, a better estimation of this number would efficiently help to overcome the risk of congestion. In this paper, we proposed a novel fluid model for M2M communications, which allows gaining an enhanced understanding of the dynamics of such systems. The provided analysis of the model was used to devise a new method to estimate accurately the number of M2M devices willing to connect as well as the number of random access attempts.We proposed, then, a novel implementation of the ACB process, which dynamically computes the ACB factor according to the network's overload conditions while includes a corrective action adapting the controller action based on the mismatch existing between the computed and the targeted mean load. Compared to existing approaches, the simulation results show that the proposed algorithms allow improving considerably the estimation of the number of M2M devices' arrivals, while outperforming existing techniques in terms of the number of abandons, the success and the collision probabilities, and the average access delay.},

  abstract = {Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications are expected to be one of the major drivers of future cellular networks, due to a plethora of services provided to operators and consumers. This leads to an explosively growth of simultaneous M2M arrivals, and then a bursty random access attempts that causes a severe random access congestion. One of the key solutions to deal with such congestion is the Access Class Barring (ACB) scheme. However, this scheme presents many limits when dealing with baseline congestions. Indeed, in such conditions, it induces a synchronization of the terminals willing to connect, as we demonstrated in the paper, which results in poor performances. Thus, we proposed, in this paper, a new method to estimate accurately the number of random access attempts in a way to measure efficiently the congestion level. Then, we proposed a novel implementation of the ACB process that mainly consists of dynamically adapting the ACB factor according to the network's overload conditions. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing solutions by improving significantly the access's success probability while minimizing radio resources' underutilization.

This paper tackles the access technology selection \textemdash{} a key CRRM functionality \textemdash{} and proposes a hybrid approach that combines benefits from both network-centric and user-centric methods. Network information, that is periodically broadcasted, assists mobile users in their decisions. By broadcasting appropriate decisional information, the network tries to globally control users decision in a way to meet operator objectives. On the other hand, mobiles also integrate their needs and preferences to select their access technology so as to maximize their own utility. In comparison with other RAT selection techniques, including network-centric, hybrid and user-centric methods, simulation results prove the efficiency of our hybrid approach in enhancing resource utilization and maximizing user satisfaction.},

The value of the processed data is increasing fast and point to the fourth industrial revolution, or industry 4.0. This paper evaluates the performance of two ICT (Information and Communication Technology) protocols coming from the consumer world with an enormous potential to be used by industry. Experiments were performed to measure the round trip time using MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) and WebSocket protocols with the exchange of data between one server in Italy and another in Brazil. The results can be analyzed for each possible application and different network paths. The average latency samples using each of the protocols were similar, defining the payload size of the requests, but changing according to the way.},

  abstract = {Recently, various types of services belonging to different domains intertwine together and constitute the Big Service. In the Big Service and Internet of Things, services optimal composition is a key technology to create value-added services to satisfy users' complex requests. However, massive services that possess the same functionalities but different quality of service (QoS) are emerging on the internet. Moreover, the online performance of many online services is determined by their distribute resources. Therefore, the expected performance of a composite service depends on the creation of the optimal composite service that can meet end-to-end quality requirements while ensuring that component services have sufficient resources to support their successful execution. To this end, resource and QoSaware services optimal composition (RQ-SOC) becomes an important issue in the Big Service and Internet of Things. Moreover, with the evolution of service industries, service features in various service domains (SFSD) (priori features, correlation features and similarity features) are gradually formed. These SFSD have great influences on RQ-SOC. Thus, to effectively solve the RQ-SOC problem, this paper first defines the SFSD and describes the important influences of SFSD on RQ-SOC. Then, the improved artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC) for RQ-SOC is proposed, and a resource checking operator based on the analysis of the mutual relations between services and resources is presented. Third, the resources checking operator is integrated into the improved ABC to solve the RQ-SOC problem effectively. Finally, the experimental results show that the proposed method for RQ-SOC is feasible and effective.},

In the bandit problem we show that given n arms, it suffices to pull the arms a total of O ( (n/2) log(1/{$\delta$}) ) times to find an 2-optimal arm with probability of at least 1-{$\delta$}. This bound matches the lower bound of Mannor and Tsitsiklis (2004) up to constants. We also devise action elimination procedures in reinforcement learning algorithms. We describe a framework that is based on learning the confidence interval around the value function or the Q-function and eliminating actions that are not optimal (with high probability). We provide a model-based and a model-free variants of the elimination method. We further derive stopping conditions guaranteeing that the learned policy is approximately optimal with high probability. Simulations demonstrate a considerable speedup and added robustness over 2-greedy Q-learning.},

For the adversarial multi-armed bandit problem, where the sequence of rewards is chosen by an oblivious adversary, the notion of best arm during the time horizon is too restrictive for applications such as ad-serving, where the best ad could change during time range. In this paper, we consider a variant of the adversarial multi-armed bandit problem, where the time horizon is divided into unknown time periods within which rewards are drawn from stochastic distributions. During each time period, there is an optimal arm which may be different from the optimal arm at the previous time period. We present an algorithm taking advantage of the constant exploration of EXP3 to detect when the best arm changes. Its analysis shows that on a run divided into N periods where the best arm changes, the proposed algorithms achieves a regret in O(N {$\surd$}T log T).},

  title = {Stochastic {{Multi}}-{{Armed}}-{{Bandit Problem}} with {{Non}}-Stationary {{Rewards}}},
  abstract = {In a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem a gambler needs to choose at each round of play one of K arms, each characterized by an unknown reward distribution. Reward realizations are only observed when an arm is selected, and the gambler's objective is to maximize his cumulative expected earnings over some given horizon of play T . To do this, the gambler needs to acquire information about arms (exploration) while simultaneously optimizing immediate rewards (exploitation); the price paid due to this trade off is often referred to as the regret, and the main question is how small can this price be as a function of the horizon length T . This problem has been studied extensively when the reward distributions do not change over time; an assumption that supports a sharp characterization of the regret, yet is often violated in practical settings. In this paper, we focus on a MAB formulation which allows for a broad range of temporal uncertainties in the rewards, while still maintaining mathematical tractability. We fully characterize the (regret) complexity of this class of MAB problems by establishing a direct link between the extent of allowable reward ``variation'' and the minimal achievable regret, and by establishing a connection between the adversarial and the stochastic MAB frameworks.},

We first study the unique best arm setting when there exists one unique best arm. Second, we study the general switching best arm setting when a best arm switches at some unknown steps. For both settings, we target problem-dependent bounds, instead of the more conservative problem-free bounds. We consider two classical problems: (1) identify a best arm with high probability (best arm identification), for which the performance measure by the sample complexity (number of samples before finding a near-optimal arm). To this end, we naturally extend the definition of sample complexity so that it makes sense in the switching best arm setting, which may be of independent interest. (2) Achieve the smallest cumulative regret (regret minimization) where the regret is measured with respect to the strategy pulling an arm with the best instantaneous mean at each step.},

This aggravates the already over-congested unlicensed radio bands, calling for new mechanisms to improve spectrum management and energy efficiency, such as transmission power control. Existing protocols are based on simplistic heuristics that often approach interference problems (i.e., packet loss, delay and energy waste) by increasing power, leading to detrimental results. The scope of this work is to investigate how machine learning may be used to bring wireless nodes to the lowest possible transmission power level and, in turn, to respect the quality requirements of the overall network. Lowering transmission power has benefits in terms of both energy consumption and interference. We propose a protocol of transmission power control through a reinforcement learning process that we have set in a multi-agent system. The agents are independent learners using the same exploration strategy and reward structure, leading to an overall cooperative network. The simulation results show that the system converges to an equilibrium where each node transmits at the minimum power while respecting high packet reception ratio constraints. Consequently, the system benefits from low energy consumption and packet delay.},

  abstract = {In the next-generation heterogeneous wireless networks, a mobile terminal with a multi-interface may have network access from different service providers using various technologies. In spite of this heterogeneity, seamless intersystem mobility is a mandatory requirement. One of the major challenges for seamless mobility is the creation of a network selection scheme, which is for users that select an optimal network with best comprehensive performance between different types of networks. However, the optimal network may be not the most reasonable one due to compensation of MADM (Multiple Attribute Decision Making), and the network is called pseudo-optimal network. This paper conducts a performance evaluation of a number of widely used MADM-based methods for network selection that aim to keep the mobile users always best connected anywhere and anytime, where subjective weight and objective weight are all considered. The performance analysis shows that the selection scheme based on MEW (weighted multiplicative method) and combination weight can better avoid accessing pseudo-optimal network for balancing network load and reducing ping-pong effect in comparison with three other MADM solutions.},

  abstract = {The Internet of Things paradigm has brought opportunities to meet several challenges by interconnecting IoT resources, such as sensors, actuators, and gateways on a massive scale. The IoT gateways play an important role in the IoT applications to bridge between sensor networks and the external environment through the Internet. Typically, the IoT gateways collect and send the data collected from sensors and actuators to external platforms where they will be remotely analyzed. However, the users desire a more adapted IoT gateway that can improve the IoT data privacy preservation before sending them to these external platforms. Thus, an IoT gateway that enables a better control over the set of private IoT resources and protects the collected personal data and their privacy is required. For this purpose, we propose a Semantic IoT Gateway that helps implement a dynamic and flexible privacy-preserving solution for the IoT domain. First, it enables to match between the data consumer's terms of service and the data owner's privacy preferences by generating an adapted privacy policy. Second, it converts the privacy policy into a custom smart contract. Finally, it connects a set of private IoT resources to a distributed network using the blockchain technology to host the generated smart contracts. A smart contract is an executable code that runs on top of the blockchain to facilitate, execute and enforce an agreement between untrusted parties without the involvement of a trusted third party. Our proposal, which is highlighted through an example and experimentation on a real-world use-case, has given the expected results.},

When employing visual sensors in that scenario, still images and video streams may be retrieved from monitored areas, potentially providing valuable data for many applications. Actually, visual sensor networks may need to be highly dynamic, reflecting the changing of parameters in smart cities. In this context, characteristics of visual sensors and conditions of the monitored environment, as well as the status of other concurrent monitoring systems, may affect how visual sensors collect, encode and transmit information. This paper proposes a fuzzy-based approach to dynamically configure the way visual sensors will operate concerning sensing, coding and transmission patterns, exploiting different types of reference parameters. This innovative approach can be considered as the basis for multi-systems smart city applications based on visual monitoring, potentially bringing significant results for this research field.},

But this way of transmitting information through the cluster can lead to uneven energy consumption in the network, which is known as the ``hot zone'' problem. However, the uneven clusters, the way of multi-hop transmission between clusters can solve this problem. According to the characteristics of routing in wireless sensor network, this paper analyzes the defects and disadvantages of the current routing algorithm. This paper proposes a series of improvement measures for the current uneven clustering routing algorithm. This paper proposes a new algorithm which has a longer network life and better stability compared with the existing routing algorithm through experimental results and analysis.},

This paper proposes constructing a differentially private index to an outsourced encrypted dataset. Efficiency is enabled by using a cleartext index structure to perform range queries. Security relies on both differential privacy (of the index) and semantic security (of the encrypted dataset). Our solution, PINED-RQ develops algorithms for building and updating the differentially private index. Compared to state-ofthe-art secure index based range query processing approaches, PINED-RQ executes queries in the order of at least one magnitude faster. The security of PINED-RQ is proved and its efficiency is assessed by an extensive experimental validation.},

Sensing the environment also carries constraints related to the interest of sensing points in relation to a physical phenomenon. Thus, criteria for designs are evolving a lot from the existing methods, especially in complex terrains. This article describes simulation techniques based on geography analysis to compute long-range radio coverages and radio characteristics in these situations. As radio propagation is just a particular case of physical phenomena, it is shown how a unified approach also allows for characterizing the behavior of potential physical risks. The case of heavy rainfall and flooding is investigated. Geography analysis is achieved using segmentation tools to produce cellular systems which are in turn translated into code for high-performance computations. The paper provides results from practical complex terrain experiments using LoRa, which confirm the accuracy of the simulation, and scheduling characteristics for sample networks. Performance tables are produced for these simulations on current Graphics Processing Units (GPUs).},

The message delivery between participated nodes and gateway in the WSNs affects the quality of service (QoS) such as energy consumption and the successful delivery rate (SDR). In this paper, we present a novel packet transmission model for a smart wireless paging sensor network (WPSN) based on LoRaWAN, which supports a real-time elderly care application. The model is used to investigate the performance of star topology communication on elderly care via Markov discrete-time M/M/1 queuing system. The proposed traffic model enables the performance evaluation of WPSN for elderly care. Moreover, an optimal cluster allocation policy is proposed by which maximizing SDR are obtained and QoS constraint requirements are met in terms of energy consumption. We conduct analytic analysis and simulation to exploit the QoS of LoRa based WSNs for elderly care application. The proposed WPSN is experimental studied and validated in a real elder care scenario.

  title = {A {{Heuristic}}-{{Based Private Bitcoin Payment Network Formation Using Off}}-{{Chain Links}}},
  abstract = {While Bitcoin dominates the market for cryptocurrencies, its use in micropayments is still a challenge due to its long transaction validation times and high fees. Recently, the concept of off-chain payments is introduced that led to the idea of establishing a payment network called Lightning Network (LN). Off-chain links provide the ability to do transactions without writing to Blockchain. However, LN's design still favors fees and is creating hub nodes that defeat the purpose of Blockchain. In addition, it is still not reliable as not all the transactions are guaranteed to be transmitted to their destinations. If current retailers would like to use it, these problems might hinder its adoption. To address this issue, in this paper, we advocate creating a private payment network among a given set of retailers that will serve their business needs, just like the idea of private Blockchains. The goal is to build a pure peer-to-peer topology that will eliminate the need for relays and increase the robustness of payments. Using off-chain links as edges and retailers as nodes, the problem is formulated as a multi-flow commodity problem where transactions represent the commodities from various sources to destinations. As the multi-flow commodity problem is NP-Complete, we propose a heuristic approach that utilizes Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm in a dynamic way by updating the edge weights when new payment paths are to be found. The order of transactions is randomized to provide fairness among the retailers. The evaluations indicate that the proposed heuristic comes close to an optimal solution while providing scalability and user privacy.},

  title = {{{DaiMoN}}: {{A Decentralized Artificial Intelligence Model Network}}},
  abstract = {We introduce DaiMoN, a decentralized artificial intelligence model network, which incentivizes peer collaboration in improving the accuracy of machine learning models for a given classification problem. It is an autonomous network where peers may submit models with improved accuracy and other peers may verify the accuracy improvement. The system maintains an append-only decentralized ledger to keep the log of critical information, including who has trained the model and improved its accuracy, when it has been improved, by how much it has improved, and where to find the newly updated model. DaiMoN rewards these contributing peers with cryptographic tokens. A main feature of DaiMoN is that it allows peers to verify the accuracy improvement of submitted models without knowing the test labels. This is an essential component in order to mitigate intentional model overfitting by model-improving peers. To enable this model accuracy evaluation with hidden test labels, DaiMoN uses a novel learnable Distance Embedding for Labels (DEL) function proposed in this paper. Specific to each test dataset, DEL scrambles the test label vector by embedding it in a low-dimension space while approximately preserving the distance between the dataset's test label vector and a label vector inferred by the classifier. It therefore allows proof-of-improvement (PoI) by peers without providing them access to true test labels. We provide analysis and empirical evidence that under DEL, peers can accurately assess model accuracy. We also argue that it is hard to invert the embedding function and thus, DEL is resilient against attacks aiming to recover test labels in order to cheat. Our prototype implementation of DaiMoN is available at https://github.com/steerapi/daimon.},

  abstract = {For the sake of protecting data privacy and due to the rapid development of mobile devices, e.g., powerful central processing unit (CPU) and nascent neural processing unit (NPU), collaborative machine learning on mobile devices, e.g., federated learning, has been envisioned as a new AI approach with broad application prospects. However, the learning process of the existing federated learning platforms rely on the direct communication between the model owner, e.g., central cloud or edge server, and the mobile devices for transferring the model update. Such a direct communication may be energy inefficient or even unavailable in mobile environments. In this paper, we consider adopting the relay network to construct a cooperative communication platform for supporting model update transfer and trading. In the system, the mobile devices generate model updates based on their training data. The model updates are then forwarded to the model owner through the cooperative relay network. The model owner enjoys the learning service provided by the mobile devices. In return, the mobile devices charge the model owner certain prices. Due to the coupled interference of wireless transmission among the mobile devices that use the same relay node, the rational mobile devices have to choose their relay nodes as well as deciding on their transmission powers. Thus, we formulate a Stackelberg game model to investigate the interaction among the mobile devices and that between the mobile devices and the model owner. The Stackelberg equilibrium is investigated by capitalizing on the exterior point method. Moreover, we provide a series of insightful analytical and numerical results on the equilibrium of the Stackelberg game.},

  abstract = {With the increasing demand for the data-intensive wireless multimedia services over the time-varying wireless channels, the big-data based wireless networks demand the 5G candidate framework to process such massive amount of multimedia data without causing extra burden to the backhaul links in supporting the heterogeneous statistical delay-bounded quality-of-service (QoS) provisionings. Due to the benefits of energy harvesting (EH) technologies, wireless devices are able to support the dataintensive wireless multimedia services by harvesting energy from the environment. Energy harvesting has emerged as the promising technology to solve the energy supply problem while bringing new challenges due to the stochastic nature of the harvested energy in supporting the heterogeneous statistical quality-of-service (QoS) provisionings. However, due to the unknown dynamics of the harvested energy as well as the channel state information (CSI), it is challenging to design the efficient routing protocol for selecting the optimal routing and power allocation policies under the statistical delay-bounded QoS constraints. To overcome the aforementioned problems, in this paper we propose the Q-learning based optimal routing and power allocation policies through learning from the history of the energy harvesting process while satisfying the heterogeneous statistical delay-bounded QoS constraints over multihop big-data relay networks. In particular, under the heterogeneous statistical delay-bounded QoS requirements, we formulate the endto-end effective-capacity optimization problem for the batteryfree energy harvesting based big-data multihop relay networks. Then, we apply the Markov decision process and Q-learning methods for deriving the optimal multihop routing algorithms over big-data multihop relay networks. Also conducted is a set of simulations which evaluate the system performances and show that our proposed Q-learning based multihop routing scheme outperforms the other existing schemes under the heterogeneous statistical delay-bounded QoS constraints over multihop big-data relay networks.},

  abstract = {Wireless sensor networks have been widely adopted in real-life applications. As one of the fundamental processes in constructing the network, neighbor discovery is to find out the existence of the nearby nodes. In order to enlarge the lifetime of each node, the nodes switch the radio OFF for most of the time, and only turn the radio ON for necessary communications. The fraction of time that the radio in ON is called duty cycle and low duty cycle schedule could help save energy. Most works focus on designing efficient discovery schedule under a pre-defined low duty cycle such that the neighboring nodes can discover each other in a short time. In this paper, we study a more practical problem where each node could adjust the duty cycle dynamically by the remaining energy or the subsequent tasks, which is referred to as adjustable neighbor discovery. We first propose a general framework to handle the problem, then present two distributed algorithms that can ensure the discovery between the neighboring nodes, no matter when they start and what duty cycle they choose. We also conduct simulations to evaluate the algorithms and the results corroborate our analyses.},

Network design in IoT based WSN faces challenges like limited energy capacity, hardware resources, and unreliable environment. Issues like cost and complexity can be limited by using sensors that are heterogeneous in nature. Since replacing or recharging of nodes in action is not possible, heterogeneity in terms of energy can overcome crucial issues like energy and lifetime. In this paper, an energy efficient routing process is discussed that considers three different sensor node categories namely normal, intermediate and advanced nodes. Also, the basic cluster head (CH) selection threshold value is modified considering important parameters like initial and residual energy with an optimum number of CHs in the network. When compared with routing algorithms like LEACH (Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy) and SEP (Stable Election Protocol), the proposed model performs better for metrics like throughput, network stability and network lifetime for various scenarios.},

  abstract = {As the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies permeate people's daily lives, the sheer number of IoT applications has been developed to provide a wide range of services. Among all, real-time IoT services start to draw increasing attentions. Conventionally, cloud plays the role as the service provider in IoT but is no longer considered as the rational option for the real-time services due to service transmission latency and communication overhead. Therefore, we propose a novel rate-adaptive fog service delivery platform, namely RA-FSD, aiming at real-time service provisioning and network utility maximization (NUM) of the underlying IoT resources based on the newly emerged fog computing paradigm. The platform leverages fog nodes as either fog service provider to offer timely services for end users, or service intermediaries to help track network conditions and mitigate communication overhead. By doing so, service consumers would always benefit from the fact that services produced by IoT applications are in their proximity and thus delivered to destination in a prompt manner. A service rate-adaptive algorithm is also developed as the key component of the RA-FSD platform to handle the abrupt changes happened in IoT network, dynamically adjust service delivery rate based on the network condition while retaining satisfactory Quality of Service (QoS) to each service consumer, and support both elastic and inelastic network services from heterogeneous IoT applications.},

Most of the transmission technologies explicitly designed for IoT and machine-to-machine communication use either an ALOHA-based channel access or some type of Listen Before Talk strategy, based on carrier sensing. In this article, we provide a comparative overview of the uncoordinated channel access methods for Internet of Things technologies, namely ALOHA-based and Listen Before Talk schemes, in relation to the ETSI and FCC regulatory frameworks. Furthermore, we provide a performance comparison of these access schemes, in terms of both successful transmissions and energy efficiency, in a typical Internet of Things deployment. Results show that Listen Before Talk is effective in reducing inter-node interference even for long-range transmissions, although the energy efficiency can be lower than that provided by ALOHA methods. Furthermore, the adoption of rate adaptation schemes lowers the energy consumption while improving the fairness among nodes at different distances from the receiver. Coexistence issues are also investigated, showing that in massive deployments Listen Before Talk is severely affected by the presence of ALOHA devices in the same area.},

In this paper, we propose a patch for the LTE module of ns-3, one of the most prominent open-source network simulators, to improve the accuracy of the routine that simulates the LTE Random Access Channel (RACH). The patched version of the random access procedure is compared with the default one and the issues arising from massive simultaneous access from mobile terminals in LTE are assessed via a simulation campaign.},

Smart devices are composed of several components including sensors, boards, batteries, processing units, and antennas. However, the form and size of the smart devices are usually limited due to antenna restrictions. In this paper, we propose the architecture of a compact low-cost LoRa smart device designed for easy deployment in smart building applications. The proposed device architecture features a reduced size embedded antenna and an ultra-low-power microcontroller to interface several sensors and actuators. The results obtained have shown that the proposed design can be used for communication, between two compact LoRa devices, in line-of-sight for up to 4.2 km, in urban environments for up to 1.2 km and also for in-building communications for up to 152 m, without compromising the low-power features that LoRa supports.},

We are now able 27 to communicate and interact with our surrounding environment through the use of multi- 28 ple tiny sensors, RFID technologies or small wireless robots. This allows a set of new appli- 29 cations and usages to be envisioned ranging from logistic and traceability purposes to 30 emergency and rescue operations going through the monitoring of volcanos or forest fires. 31 However, all this comes with several technical and scientific issues like how to ensure the 32 reliability of wireless communications in disturbed environments, how to manage effi- 33 ciently the low resources (energy, memory, etc.) or how to set a safe and sustainable (both 34 hardware and software) platform maintenance. All these issues are addressed by research- 35 ers all around the world but solutions designed for IoT need to face real experimentations 36 to be validated. To ease such experimentations for IoT, several experimental testbeds have 37 been deployed offering diverse and heterogeneous services and tools. In this article, we 38 study the different requirements and features such facilities should offer. We survey the 39 different experimental facilities currently available for the community, describe their char- 40 acteristics. In particular, we detail the different hardware used for sensor networks and 41 robot platforms and the scope of services the different facilities offer with a specific focus 42 on testbeds which enable experimentations with mobility. We expect this survey assist a 43 potential user to easily choose the one to use regarding his own needs. Finally, we identify 44 existing gaps and difficulties and investigate new directions for such facilities.},

We consider the entire network energy while choosing the next hop for the routed packets in the targeted wireless sensor network. Our delivery approach considers resource limitations in terms of hop count, and remaining-energy levels. Extensive simulations are performed and achieved results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach in comparison to other baseline energy-aware routing protocols in the literature.},

Since LoRa/LoRaWAN supports various data rates, we firstly derive the fairest ratios of deploying each data rate within a cell for a fair collision probability. LoRa/LoRaWAN, like other frequency modulation based radio interfaces, exhibits the capture effect in which only the stronger signal of colliding signals will be extracted. This leads to unfairness, where far nodes or nodes experiencing higher attenuation are less likely to see their packets received correctly. Therefore, we secondly develop a transmission power control algorithm to balance the received signal powers from all nodes regardless of their distances from the gateway for a fair data extraction. Simulations show that our approach achieves higher fairness in data rate than the state-of-art in almost all network configurations.},

In general, two main categories of networks are used in the IoT: short-range and long-range low-power networks. IPv6 over low-power wireless personal area networks (6LoWPAN) are considered to be a crucial network in short-range low-power networks where 6LoWPAN motes will account for the majority of short-range low-power things. Also, LoRaWAN and SigFox are two major networking landscapes and players in long-range, low-power networks or oftentimes called low-power wide area networks (LPWAN). This paper reviews and compares 6LoWPAN and LPWAN in terms of network architecture, protocol stack, applications and security. In general, LPWAN networks are more demanding in terms of node and link constraints than 6LoWPAN networks (e.g. very low payload size, very low data rate and very limited resources). Also, as yet, LPWAN networks do not have IPv6 addressing capabilities. Each network category has its unique characteristics and strengths and each category has its important role in the IoT world.},

These types of technologies provide the Internet of Things (IoT) devices with the ability to transmit few bytes of data for long ranges, taking into consideration minimum power consumption. In parallel, IoT applications will cover a wide range of human and life needs from smart environments (cities, home, transportation etc.) to health and quality of life. Among these popular LPWANs technologies, we have identified the unlicensed frequency band (LoRa, DASH7, SigFox, Wi-SUN, etc.), and the licensed frequency band standards (NB-IoT, LTE Cat-M, EC-GSM-IoT, etc.). In general, both types of standards only consider fixed interconnected things, and less attention has been provided to the mobility of the things or devices. In this paper, we address the mobility of the things and the connectivity in each of the three LPWAN standards: LoRaWAN, DASH7, and NB-IoT. In particular, we show how the mobility of things can be achieved when transmitting and receiving data. Then, we provide a general and technical comparison for the three standards. Finally, we illustrate several application scenarios where the mobility is required, and we show how to select the most suited standard. We also discuss the research challenges and perspectives.},

Most cities experiencing these difficulties can, therefore, use stand-alone LoRaWAN base station solutions and provide good coverage of the area. Leftovers can claim to have access to acceptable connectivity, and therefore cheaper wireless communication, giving direct access to Internet from the collection node, will be required for data transmission: Wi-Fi can attain these objectives. In this article, we first examine the existing tools to ensure a good coverage study of the LoRaWAN network and, thus, perform a testBed. After, we offer a multi-optional architectural model that supports LoRaWAN and Wi-Fi protocols and that is flexible for other options. A gateway (Wi-IoT) capable of both providing Wi-Fi access and at the same time the ability to collect, process and monitor data as a mini-server will be proposed as proof of concept. From the node to the gateway, the data is compressed and sent securely and a user who connects to the gateway can, then, have access to the data.},

  abstract = {We are on the entry of the exponential advancement of the internet-of-things (IoT) due to the quick development of internetconnected smart-objects. As the number of connected smart-objects increase, IoT will continue to advance by providing connectivity and interactions between the physical and the cyber world. This connectivity is characterized by low throughput, delay sensitivity, small and wide coverage, low power consumption, low device, etc. Which explains the emergence of low power wide area network (LPWAN). LPWAN technologies are an alternative promising connectivity solutions for Internet of Things. However, the lack of an overall LPWAN knowledge that present a comprehensive analysis of LPWAN technologies is presently constraining the achievement of the modern IoT vision. In this paper, we begin with a detailed analysis of the conventional high power long-range network technologies that considers IoT applications and requirements. We further point out the need for dedicated low power wide area technologies in IoT systems. In addition, we analyse the technical specification based on the PHY and MAC layers of the technologies that are already deployed, or likely to be deployed. The focus is to incorporate both standard and proprietary technologies in our study. Furthermore, we present the modelling techniques and performance metrics that are adopted in LPWAN networks analysis. Finally, challenges and open problems are presented. The main contribution of this study is that it provides an enhanced summary of the current state-of-the-art of LPWAN suitable to meet the requirements of IoT, while uniquely providing LPWAN's modelling techniques, performance metrics and their associated enablers.},

  abstract = {LoRa's long-range and low-power features have made it an attractive candidate for IoT devices in various fields. In this work, we present an enhanced LoRaWAN protocol. LoRaWAN MAC protocol is characterized by the restrictive use of the channel, limited by the regulatory authorities to a 1\% duty cycle per cycle (i.e., 36 s per hour) per node. This regulation penalizes the nodes which require a channel access time greater than the limited duty cycle to occasionally transmit a large amount of data such as video surveillance or access control information in applications like smart school surveillance. However, some other nodes like environment sensors sharing a same LoRaWAN server may send very small amounts of information (e.g. temperature, humidity, ...) and under-use the authorized activity time of 1\% duty cycle. Hence the idea of implementing an activity time sharing mechanism among nodes that allows devices to borrow additional activity time from a device or set of devices that have completed the transmission of their packets and do not need the remaining time of the corresponding duty cycle. Our work extends and improves the activity time sharing mechanism initially proposed in [1]. Instead of FIFO sharing-time allocation based on a global activity time, which may lead to the starvation of the nodes that are others than that in the head of FIFO line, we propose a new time allocation algorithm based on the classification of the different requests according to their needs in terms of their QoS requirements. It allows to satisfy a larger number of nodes requiring extra time, with less control overheads while ensuring fairness. Our time-sharing algorithm has been implemented and tested on the wasp-mote chip of libelium, showing the performance improvement and its practical usability.},

We assume a space-time Poisson model of packets transmitted by LoRA nodes to a fixed base station. Following previous studies of the impact of interference [8, 10], we assume that a given packet is successfully received when no interfering packet arrives with similar power before the given packet payload phase. This is as a consequence of LoRa using different transmission rates for different link budgets (transmissions with smaller received powers use larger spreading factors) and LoRa intra-technology interference treatment. Using our model, we study the scaling of the packet reception probabilities per link budget as a function of the spatial density of nodes and their rate of transmissions. We consider both the parameter values recommended by the LoRa provider, as well as proposing LoRa tuning to improve the equality of performance for all link budgets. We also consider spatially non-homogeneous distributions of LoRa nodes. We show also how a fair comparison to non-slotted Aloha can be made within the same framework.},

Since 2015, the role-out and adoption of LoRaWAN has seen a steep growth. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to have extensively measured, analyzed, and modeled the performance, features, and use cases of an operational LoRaWAN, namely The Things Network. Our measurement data, as presented in this paper, cover the early stages up to the production-level deployment of LoRaWAN. In particular, we analyze packet payloads, radio-signal quality, and spatiotemporal aspects, to model and estimate the performance of LoRaWAN. We also use our empirical findings in simulations to estimate the packet-loss.},

LPWAN devices typically communicate directly to a sink node which removes the need of constructing and maintaining a complex multi-hop network. However, to ensure efficient and reliable communication LPWAN devices often provide a large number of transmission parameters. For example, a LoRa device can be configured to use different spreading factors, bandwidth settings, coding rates and transmission powers, resulting in over 6720 possible settings. It is a challenge to determine the setting that minimises transmission energy cost while meeting the required communication performance. This paper is the first to present a thorough analysis of the impact of LoRa transmission parameter selection on communication performance. We study in detail the impact of parameter settings on energy consumption and communication reliability. Using this study we develop a link probing regime which enables us to quickly determine transmission settings that satisfy performance requirements. The presented work is a first step towards an automated mechanism for LoRa transmission parameter selection that a deployed LoRa network requires, but is not yet specified within the Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) framework.},

  abstract = {New Internet of Things (IoT) technologies such as Long Range (LoRa) are emerging which enable power efficient wireless communication over very long distances. Devices typically communicate directly to a sink node which removes the need of constructing and maintaining a complex multihop network. Given the fact that a wide area is covered and that all devices communicate directly to a few sink nodes a large number of nodes have to share the communication medium. LoRa provides for this reason a range of communication options (centre frequency, spreading factor, bandwidth, coding rates) from which a transmitter can choose. Many combination settings are orthogonal and provide simultaneous collision free communications. Nevertheless, there is a limit regarding the number of transmitters a LoRa system can support. In this paper we investigate the capacity limits of LoRa networks. Using experiments we develop models describing LoRa communication behaviour. We use these models to parameterise a LoRa simulation to study scalability. Our experiments show that a typical smart city deployment can support 120 nodes per 3.8 ha, which is not sufficient for future IoT deployments. LoRa networks can scale quite well, however, if they use dynamic communication parameter selection and/or multiple sinks.},

Most Internet of Thing (IoT) applications require sensor nodes to operate reliably for an extended period of time. To design an autonomous sensor node, it is important to model its energy consumption for different tasks. Each task consumes a power consumption amount for a period of time. To optimize the consumed energy of the sensor node and have long communication range, Low Power Wide Area Network technology is considered. This paper describes an energy consumption model based on LoRa and LoRaWAN, which allows estimating the consumed power of each sensor node element. The definition of the different node units is first introduced. Then, a full energy model for communicating sensors is proposed. This model can be used to compare different LoRaWAN modes to find the best sensor node design to achieve its energy autonomy.},

Therefore, a cross-layer design is imperative to effectively realize Low Power Wide Area networks (LPWANs). In the present paper, a cross-layer assessment framework including power modeling is proposed. Through this simulation framework, the energy consumption of IoT devices, currently deployed in LoRaWAN networks, is evaluated. We demonstrate that a cross-layer approach significantly improves energy efficiency and overall throughput. Two major contributions are made. First, an opensource LPWAN assessment framework has been conceived. It allows testing and evaluating hypotheses and schemes. Secondly, as a representative case, the LoRaWAN protocol is assessed. The findings indicate how a cross-layer approach can optimize LPWANs in terms of energy efficiency and throughput. For instance, it is shown that the use of larger payloads can reduce up to three times the energy consumption on quasi-static channels yet may bring an energy penalty under adverse dynamic conditions.},

In this paper we show that an incautious use of this feature can bring a sharp decrease in the performance of the network, especially for large scale deployments. Additionally, we present some insights on how certain design choices for downlink communication in LoRaWAN are impairing confirmed traffic usage and propose some solutions to mitigate the issue.},

In this work we propose a mathematical model that makes it possible to accurately estimate the packet success probability of a LoRaWAN network in presence of bi-directional traffic, i.e., both uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) transmissions, and that accounts for the most critical features of the LoRa chipset and the LoRaWAN standard. The proposed model, furthermore, makes it possible to study the effect of different parameters configurations, thus offering a valid tool to investigate possible improvements to the system configuration. The proposed model is first validated by comparison with some accurate simulation results and, then, its potential is exemplified by analyzing the system settings that yield the best network performance.},

Many LoRaWAN end-devices, such as sensors or actuators, are expected not to be powered by the electricity grid; therefore, it is crucial to investigate the energy consumption of LoRaWAN. However, published works have only focused on this topic to a limited extent. In this paper, we present analytical models that allow the characterization of LoRaWAN end-device current consumption, lifetime and energy cost of data delivery. The models, which have been derived based on measurements on a currently prevalent LoRaWAN hardware platform, allow us to quantify the impact of relevant physical and Medium Access Control (MAC) layer LoRaWAN parameters and mechanisms, as well as Bit Error Rate (BER) and collisions, on energy performance. Among others, evaluation results show that an appropriately configured LoRaWAN end-device platform powered by a battery of 2400 mAh can achieve a 1-year lifetime while sending one message every 5 min, and an asymptotic theoretical lifetime of 6 years for infrequent communication.},

  abstract = {Recent technological innovations allow compact radios to transmit over long distances with minimal energy consumption and could drastically affect the way Internet of Things (IoT) technologies communicate in the near future. By extending the communication range of links, it is indeed possible to reduce the network diameter to a point that each node can communicate with almost every other node in the network directly. This drastically simplifies communication, removing the need of routing, and significantly reduces the overhead of data collection. Long-range low-power wireless technology, however, is still at its infancy, and it is yet unclear (i) whether it is sufficiently reliable to complement existing short-range and cellular technologies and (ii) which radio settings can sustain a high delivery rate while maximizing energy-efficiency. To shed light on this matter, this paper presents an extensive experimental study of the reliability of LoRa , one of the most promising long-range low-power wireless technologies to date. We focus our evaluation on the impact of physical layer settings on the effective data rate and energy efficiency of communications. Our results show that it is often not worth tuning parameters, thereby reducing the data rate in order to maximize the probability of successful reception, especially on links at the edge of their communication range. Furthermore, we study the impact of environmental factors on the performance of LoRa, and show that higher temperatures significantly decrease the received signal strength and may drastically affect packet reception.},

A promising technology to achieve the low-power and long-range requirements is seen in LoRaWAN, a media access control (MAC) protocol maintained by the LoRa Alliance and leveraging Semtech's patented LoRa radio modulation technology. LoRaWAN provides three different device classes (A, B and C), which provide a tradeoff between performance (i.e., throughput and latency) and energy consumption. This paper offers a theoretical and experimental comparison of these classes. The objective of the quantitative experiment was twofold: to verify the published current levels of different operating modes in a LoRa chip's datasheet and to compare the battery lifetime for the LoRa class A and C modes of operation. We used a high-end current sensing circuit to gather the voltage levels and temporal variation with increasing payload sizes and spreading factors. Using the Ohmic Law, the energy drain can be calculated and compared across the different spreading factors (SF) and classes.},

LoRa technology achieves wide coverage areas, low power consumption and robustness to interference thanks to a chirp spread-spectrum modulation, in which chirps modulated with different spreading factors (SFs) are quasi-orthogonal. We focus on the performance analysis of a single receiver in presence of collisions. First, we analyze LoRa modulation numerically and show that collisions between packets modulated with different SFs can indeed cause packet loss if the interference power received is strong enough. Second, we validate such findings in experiments based on commercial devices and softwaredefined radios. Contradicting the common belief that SFs can be considered orthogonal, our results demonstrate that interSF collisions are indeed an issue in LoRa networks and, thus, allocating higher SFs to users far from the gateway might not necessarily improve their link capacity, in case of congested networks.},

  abstract = {In this paper we study the impact of imperfect-orthogonality in LoRa spreading factors (SFs) in simulation and real-world experiments. First, we analyze LoRa modulation numerically and show that collisions between packets of different SFs can indeed cause packet loss if the interference power received is strong enough. Second, we validate such findings using commercial devices, confirming our numerical results. Third, we modified and extended LoRaSim, an open-source LoRa simulator, to measure the impact of inter-SF collisions and fading (which was not taken into account previously in the simulator). Our results show that non-orthogonality of the SFs can deteriorate significantly the performance especially of higher SFs (10 to 12) and that fading has virtually no impact when multiple gateways are available in space diversity.},

  abstract = {To exploit the LoRaWAN (Long-Range Wide Area Network), it is essential to design suitable allocation schemes for the wireless resources. To this aim, strategies for a fair allocation of Spreading Factors (SF) among the network devices have been presented. These strategies greatly outperform the basic Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) scheme. Within these techniques, EXPLoRa-AT yields so far the best results exploiting an ``ordered water-filling'' approach which aims to equalize the Air-Time channel usage for each group of devices using the same SF. This paper proposes two innovative schemes based on the former one, named EXPLoRaKM (K-means) and EXPLoRa-TS (Time Symbol). Both schemes exploit the ``ordered water-filling'' approach, and apply further heuristics based on network traffic knowledge. EXPLoRa-KM aims to relieve critical regions, characterized by a significant number of collisions, computing suitable adjustments on the SF allocation using K-means. Conversely, and with incremented complexity, EXPLoRa-TS performs an equalization of the traffic load (measured in symbol times) among the SF channels. The latter takes into account the fact that each device, according to its application, transmits a variable amount of data at a different sending rate. Thus, different traffic types (more or less aggressive) can be recognized. Simulation results show how both heuristics give significant performance improvements when different traffic loads are generated around a LoRaWAN Gateway. Taking into account the traffic behavior, the techniques provided in this paper contribute as promising kick-off strategies for enhancing the network performance in order to come up with the ultimate goal of scalability on a LoRaWAN network for heterogeneous IoT scenarios.},

  abstract = {LoRaWAN is emerging as an attractive network infrastructure for ultra low power Internet of Thing devices. Albeit the technology itself is quite mature and specified, how to effectively allocate wireless resources so as to support a large amount of devices in a same terrestrial area is an open challenge. This paper contributes by proposing two algorithms (of incremental complexity) which are shown to outperform the basic Adaptive Rate Strategy (ADR) so far considered. A first approach, named EXPLoRa-SF, shows the benefits of a simple strategy which does not limit to use (as per ADR) distance/RSSI measurements, but also selects Spreading Factors (SF) based on the total number of connected devices. The advantages attained with EXPLoRa-SF further lead us to propose a more sophisticated algorithm, named EXPLoRa-AT, which employs an innovative ``ordered waterfilling'' approach which attempts to allocate the spreading factors so as to equalize the Time on Air of the packets transmitted by the system's end devices in each spreading factor's group. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms significantly outperform the basic ADR strategy, and particularly the EXPLoRa-AT algorithm appears very robust to different operating conditions and consistently guarantees high bit rates in the case of high traffic loads.},

Recently, both academia and industry are attracted to LoRaWAN because of its recent developments and applicability in the IoT environment. Mostly, the IoT concept involves massive end devices distributed over a wide topographical area, hence establishing a high density and large-scale environment. LoRaWAN makes use of six orthogonal spreading factors (SFs) in order to improve spectral efficiency and increase the capacity. In this paper, we focus on the LoRaWAN class A network end devices and the problem of network scalability under high-density urban environment by using both the confirmed and unconfirmed mode of communication. Simulation results show that the urban environment has a high impact on the distribution of SFs, thus leading to low network performance in terms of success ratio. We also observed that the use of acknowledgment limits the scalability of the LoRaWAN due to the duty cycle constraints. However, this study further reveals that elevating the antenna height can significantly improve the performance in an urban area.},

For device simplicity, LPWANs tend to use a simple channel access control protocol such as Aloha, which impacts performance. While several LPWAN technologies are available, we specifically focus on the Long Range (LoRa) in this paper. Our goal in this study is to search for a channel access control protocol in conjunction with the LoRa physical layer that can improve network performance in terms of reliability, throughput, energy consumption, and yet retain simplicity. We analyze a range of channel access control protocols, such as pure Aloha, delay before transmit, random frequency hopping, and carrier sense multiple access (CSMA). Our experiments use available periodic and event-based data traffic generation models for Internet of Things applications. Our results show that, CSMA and random frequency hopping demonstrate significantly better performance for both periodic and event-based data traffic models. Moreover, CSMA also exhibits scalability features in terms of the number of nodes in a network and data traffic generation models.},

At this time of fast-paced adoption, it is of utmost importance to analyse how well these technologies will scale as the number of devices connected to the Internet of Things (IoT) inevitably grows. In this letter, we provide a stochastic geometry framework for modelling the performance of a single gateway LoRa network, a leading LPWA technology. Our analysis formulates unique peculiarities of LoRa, including its chirp spread-spectrum modulation technique, regulatory limitations on radio duty cycle, and use of ALOHA protocol on top, all of which are not as common in today's commercial cellular networks. We show that the coverage probability drops exponentially as the number of end-devices grows due to interfering signals using the same spreading sequence. We conclude that this fundamental limiting factor is perhaps more significant towards LoRa scalability than for instance spectrum restrictions. Our derivations for co-spreading factor interference found in LoRa networks enables rigorous scalability analysis of such networks.},

In LoRa communication, transmission setting plays an important role as it affects coverage range, data rate, and battery consumption. Therefore, its optimal configuration is required to ensure successful communication with long battery life. However, with small data rate and resourcelimited LoRa nodes, configuration of optimal settings becomes challenging. Current solutions require multiple transmissions for fixed distance between nodes and gateways to achieve the optimal settings. The existing methods become unsuitable for moving nodes because of continuous change in distance between the nodes and the gateways. Thus, each transmission would require different optimal setting. Due to lack of such configuration method, conventional method uses same fixed high energy setting for all transmissions to ensure high reliability, which results in shorter battery life. To minimize energy consumption without affecting reliability, the proposed method dynamically configures the optimal setting for each transmission depending on the distance between current location of the moving node and the nearest gateway, using path loss estimation. The simulation result shows that, for 95\% reliability, the proposed method achieves 47\% reduction in energy consumption as compared with conventional method.},

This paper is concerned with the performance and scalability of LORA networks, a leading LPWAN technology. Several recently published articles have analyzed the ability of LORA networks to scale, i.e., their ability to support increased traffic and number of nodes. This work proposes to employ message replication and gateways with multiple receive antennas to achieve, respectively, time and spatial diversity. The paper presents the proposed schemes and evaluates them through theoretical analysis and computer simulations. Results show that LORA networks are highly sensitive to the increase in user and traffic density, but both message replication and multiple antennas can enhance performance. Message replication has an optimum number of message copies for each network configuration, and its utilization is more beneficial in low-density networks, while the use of multiple receive antennas at the gateway is always beneficial.},

Besides the popularity, however, academic research has shown that the technology has limitations. In particular to the connectivity argument, it became clear that massive coverage comes at the price of severely reduced duty cycles, and the increased number of users in the network significantly elevates packet loss due to collisions. In this paper, we exploit time diversity to increase the probability of successful packet delivery in LORA uplink. We build on previous work to model the outage and coverage probabilities of LORA channels and analyze the use of message replication to create signal diversity. We observed that there is an optimum number of message replicas that minimizes outage probability and avoids high collision probability. We validate the proposed model using numerical simulations.},

Therefore, LoRa is an appropriate candidate for data transmission in smart grids. In this study, the performance of a LoRa device is examined. Based on the experimental results, a routing algorithm that uses the AODV is developed for the LoRa device, and the algorithm enables a long-chain topology suitable for data transmission in a smart grid. A multi-hop mechanism is simulated to ensure a high final receiving rate of packets, by finding the optimal path with the least number of hops in the transmission topology for a power transmission line. The simulation results show a great performance of the proposed algorithm in long distance transmission.},

The massive number of connected devices associated to its random spatial deployment and random network access introduce new degrees of freedom, demanding for innovative performance evaluation approaches. In this paper we study the interference caused to a LoRa gateway due to the uplink transmissions of multiple coexisting LoRa devices. By admitting an uniform spatial distribution of the devices, we show that the aggregate interference caused to a LoRa gateway follows a nonGaussian distribution and its power can be approximated by a sum of independent non-identical gamma random variables. Our work adopts a typical LoRaWAN operating scenario where the transmissions of LoRa Class A devices are affected by path-loss, shadowing and Rayleigh fading. Numerical results obtained with the modeling methodology are compared with simulation results, and the validation of the proposed model is discussed for different transmission probabilities.},

However, the limited bandwidth available for physical layer modulation in LoRa makes it unsuitable for high bit rate data transfer from devices like image sensors. In this paper, we propose a new method for mangrove forest monitoring in Malaysia, wherein we transfer image sensor data over the LoRa physical layer (PHY) in a node-to-node network model. In implementing this method, we produce a novel scheme for overcoming the bandwidth limitation of LoRa. With this scheme the images, which requires high data rate to transfer, collected by the sensor are encrypted as hexadecimal data and then split into packets for transfer via the LoRa physical layer (PHY). To assess the quality of images transferred using this scheme, we measured the packet loss rate, peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and structural similarity (SSIM) index of each image. These measurements verify the proposed scheme for image transmission, and support the industrial and academic trend which promotes LoRa as the future solution for IoT infrastructure.},

In this paper we demonstrate the possibility to optimize the performance of the LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) technology, one of the most widely used LPWAN technology. We suggest that nodes use light-weight learning methods, namely, multi-armed bandit algorithms, to select the communication parameters (spreading factor and emission power). Extensive simulations show that such learning methods allow to manage the trade-off between energy consumption and packet loss much better than an Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) algorithm adapting spreading factors and transmission powers on the basis of Signal to Interference and Noise Ratio (SINR) values.},

This paper tackles three technical challenges that are confronted when establishing a LoRa network on a smart energy campus testbed in Korea. First, the communication range of LoRa in a combined indoor and outdoor environment has yet to be determined. To address this problem, this study builds a LoRa testbed from which we measure the propagation properties of radio signals in a combined environment. Then, we establish a simplified path loss model for LoRa PHY and compute the communication range. Next, national regulations enforce the use of the Listen-Before-Talk (LBT) scheduling scheme, but its performance has never been examined. This paper enumerates the impacts of LBT, threshold values, back-off algorithms, and application parameters on LoRa Medium Access Control (MAC) performance. Last, the application parameters required by the smart energy scenario influence LoRa performance, but their impacts have been scarcely reported. Based on the application parameters and experimental results, this paper proposes a strategy to deploy LoRa gateway(s) and nodes on the campus. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first work that considers performance issues when establishing a LoRa network on a real-world application testbed.},

  abstract = {Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs) emerged to cover the needs of Internet of Things (IoT)-devices for operational longevity and long operating range. Among LPWANs, Long Range (LoRa) WAN has been the most promising; an upcoming IoT protocol, already adopted by big mobile operators like KPN and TTN. With LoRaWANs, IoT-devices transmit data to their corresponding gateways over many kilometers in a single hop and with 1\% duty-cycle. However, in a LoRa network, any device claims the channel for data-transmission without performing channel-sensing or synchronization with other devices. This increases humongously the number of collisions of information-packets when the number of IoT-devices that are connected per gateway increases. To improve the utilization of the channel, we propose the application of persistent-Carrier Sense Multiple Access (pCSMA) protocols on the MAC layer of LoRaWANs. In this manuscript, we report on the initial design of a p-CSMA component for the simulation of LoRa networks in ns3 1. In particular, the classes adding p-CSMA functionality to the IoT-devices are presented. Additionally, the dependencies and relations between these classes and an existing LoRaWAN module on which they apply are detailed. Further, we evaluate this new p-CSMA LoRaWAN module in terms of Packet Reception Ratio (PRR) by simulating LoRa networks. The current report is the first step in the creation of a holistic p-CSMA module, directed to support network-researchers and connoisseurs in simulating all aspects of LoRa networks in ns3.},

Thus, we need realistic models, enabling the proper assessment of the performance level. Most of the time, the IoT concept entails a large number of nodes distributed over a wide geographical area, therefore forming a high density, large-scale architecture. It is important to determine the number of collisions so that we can assess the network performance. The present paper aims at assessing the performance level of the LoRaWAN technology by analyzing the number of packet collisions that can occur. Thus, this paper determines the maximum number of LoRa nodes that can communicate with a Gateway considering the LoRaWAN protocol specifications. Furthermore, we have proposed a series of solutions for reducing the number of collisions and increasing the capacity of the communication channel.},

  abstract = {Although many techniques exist to transfer data from the widely distributed sensors that make up the Internet of Things (IoT) (e.g., using 3G/4G networks or cables), these methods are associated with prohibitively high costs, making them impractical for real-life applications. Recently, several emerging wireless technologies have been proposed to provide long-range communication for IoT sensors. Among these, LoRa has been examined for long-range performance. Although LoRa shows good performance for long-range transmission in the countryside, its radio signals can be attenuated over distance, and buildings, trees, and other radio signal sources may interfere with the signals. Our observations show that in urban areas, LoRa requires dense deployment of LoRa gateways (GWs) to ensure that indoor LoRa devices can successfully transfer data back to remote GWs. Wireless mesh networking is a solution for increasing communication range and packet delivery ratio (PDR) without the need to install additional GWs. This paper presents a LoRa mesh networking system for large-area monitoring of IoT applications. We deployed 19 LoRa mesh networking devices over an 800 m \texttimes{} 600 m area on our university campus and installed a GW that collected data at 1-min intervals. The proposed LoRa mesh networking system achieved an average 88.49\% PDR, whereas the star-network topology used by LoRa achieved only 58.7\% under the same settings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first academic study discussing LoRa mesh networking in detail and evaluating its performance via real experiments.},

In this article, we jointly analyze interferences in the timefrequency domain using a stochastic geometry model assuming the total time-frequency resources to be a two-dimensional plane and transmissions from Internet of Things (IoT) devices timefrequency patterns on this plane. To evaluate the interference, we quantify the overlap between the information packets: provided that the overlap is not too strong, the packets are not necessarily lost due to capture effect. This flexible model can be used for multiple medium access scenarios and is especially adapted to the random time-frequency access schemes used in Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs).

In this letter, we analyze LoRa systems for increasing average system packet success probability (PSP) under unslotted ALOHA random access protocol. The lower bound for average system PSP is derived when many contending EDs are transmitting by stochastic geometry. And it is shown that the average system PSP can be maximized by properly allocating an SF to each traffic, which also maximizes connectivity of EDs. We formulate an optimization problem for maximizing the average system PSP to propose a sub-optimal SF allocation scheme to each traffic. Analysis on PSP is validated through simulations, and comparison with existing schemes reveals that our proposed scheme achieves the highest PSP and so the maximum connectivity.},

  abstract = {LoRaWAN is an emerging Low-Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technology, which is gaining momentum thanks to its flexibility and ease of deployment. Conversely to other LPWAN solutions, LoRaWAN indeed permits the configuration of several network parameters that affect different network performance indexes, such as energy efficiency, fairness, and capacity, in principle making it possible to adapt the network behavior to the specific requirements of the application scenario. Unfortunately, the complex and sometimes elusive interactions among the different network components make it rather difficult to predict the actual effect of a certain parameters setting, so that flexibility can turn into a stumbling block if not deeply understood. In this paper we shed light on such complex interactions, by observing and explaining the effect of different parameters settings in some illustrative scenarios. The simulation-based analysis reveals various trade-offs and highlights some inefficiencies in the design of the LoRaWAN standard. Furthermore, we show how significant performance gains can be obtained by wisely setting the system parameters, possibly in combination with some novel network management policies.},

To ensure accurate results, tests lasted at least 17 hours and required 1000 packets per node. The evaluation focused on the impact that the Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) scheme, payload length, link checks and acknowledgements had on the packet delivery ratio (PDR) of the testbed. The collected data showed that enabling the ADR scheme reduced the PDR. The ADR scheme had six data rates, which consist of a spreading factor (SF) and bandwidth (BW) combination, to choose from. Analysis revealed that the scheme primarily assigning either the fastest data rate (SF7BW250) or the slowest (SF12BW125) to nodes, regardless of distance. Furthermore, the scheme's assignments show signs of oscillation, with nodes being instructed to abruptly change between SFs. The impact of payload length and link checks on the PDR was not pronounced but enabling acknowledgements did show significant improvements.},

The current LoRa technology provides a wide range of communication settings whereas many combination settings are orthogonal and, thus, they can be successfully decoded at the gateway when the signals are transmitted simultaneously. Previous simulation results showed that the LoRa network capacity can be improved when multiple communication parameters are applied. In this paper, we model a LoRa network consisting of nodes with different communication settings in terms of bandwidth and spreading factor. We compute the average success probability per configuration as a function of density taking into account both intra and inter-spreading factor collisions. We, also, formulate and solve an optimization problem to maximize the node capacity for a given deployment area and frequency by optimizing the number of nodes having different spreading factor configurations. We present numerical results and we show that solutions close to the optimal can increase the maximum number of nodes by more than 700\% compared to case where equal number of users per spreading factor are considered.},

  abstract = {LoRa is a low-power long-range IoT standard that uses the chirp spread spectrum technique, and we have strived to further extend its coverage by utilizing the direct device-to-device (D2D) links to construct a multi-hop relay network. In LoRa, the spreading factor (SF) is an important parameter, which not only provides great flexibility between the data rate and sensitivity but also presents a new dimension for multiple accesses. Our approach to improving the capacity of a multihop LoRa network is to attempt to off-load the data traffic into several subnets by utilizing this multiple-access dimension. Each subnet rooted at a sink node is allocated a specific SF on the basis of network clustering. This enables packet transmission in parallel with multiple SFs to become feasible. To allow such parallel transmissions, our considerations are: 1) ensuring the connectivity of all subnets; 2) off-loading the traffic according to the number of nodes, data rates, and network topologies of each subnet; and 3) shortening the airtime of each subnet by reducing the hop count. Toward these objectives, we present a tree-based SF clustering algorithm (TSCA) to conduct SF allocation in a multihop LoRa network. The TSCA focuses on balancing the airtime between the subnets while ensuring connectivity. Furthermore, we use simulations to show that our approach can significantly increase the network performance compared with other approaches. We additionally deploy a real-chip experiment to evaluate the feasibility of parallel transmission in practice.},

  abstract = {Long Range (LoRa) has become one of the most popular Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) technologies, which provides a desirable trade-off among communication range, battery life, and deployment cost. In LoRa networks, several transmission parameters can be allocated to ensure efficient and reliable communication. For example, the configuration of the spreading factor allows tuning the data rate and the transmission distance. However, how to dynamically adjust the setting that minimizes the collision probability while meeting the required communication performance is an open challenge. This paper proposes a novel Data Rate and Channel Control (DRCC) scheme for LoRa networks so as to improve wireless resource utilization and support a massive number of LoRa nodes. The scheme estimates channel conditions based on the short-term Data Extraction Rate (DER), and opportunistically adjusts the spreading factor to adapt the variation of channel conditions. Furthermore, the channel control is carried out to balance the link load of all available channels with the global information of the channel usage, which is able to lower the access collisions under dense deployments. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed DRCC performs well on improving the reliability and capacity compared with other spreading factor allocation schemes in dense deployment scenarios.},

  abstract = {As LoRaWAN networks are actively being deployed in the field, it is important to comprehend the limitations of this Low Power Wide Area Network technology. Previous work has raised questions in terms of the scalability and capacity of LoRaWAN networks as the number of end devices grows to hundreds or thousands per gateway. Some works have modeled LoRaWAN networks as pure ALOHA networks, which fails to capture important characteristics such as the capture effect and the effects of interference. Other works provide a more comprehensive model by relying on empirical and stochastic techniques. This work uses a different approach where a LoRa error model is constructed from extensive complex baseband bit error rate simulations and used as an interference model. The error model is combined with the LoRaWAN MAC protocol in an ns-3 module that enables to study multi channel, multi spreading factor, multi gateway, bi-directional LoRaWAN networks with thousands of end devices. Using the lorawan ns-3 module, a scalability analysis of LoRaWAN shows the detrimental impact of downstream traffic on the delivery ratio of confirmed upstream traffic. The analysis shows that increasing gateway density can ameliorate but not eliminate this effect, as stringent duty cycle requirements for gateways continue to limit downstream opportunities.},

We also show that the module correctly represents the capture effect that lowers the packet drop rate due to collisions. Second, we want to improve the performance of LoRa devices while not impacting energy consumption, the aspect that usually is not taken into account in the literature. We use the simulator to evaluate CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access), a simple enhancement to LoRaWAN that lowers the collision ratio. The simulation results show that CSMA considerably lowers the collision ratio while only slightly increasing energy consumption. We also observe that CSMA presents lower energy consumption than LoRa for a large number of devices. Another advantage of CSMA consists of increased throughput and larger network capacity because the ETSI restrictions on the duty cycle do not longer apply.},

  abstract = {Large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) deployments demand long-range wireless communications, especially in urban and metropolitan areas. LoRa is one of the most promising technologies in this context due to its simplicity and flexibility. Indeed, deploying LoRa networks in dense IoT scenarios must achieve two main goals: efficient communications among a large number of devices and resilience against dynamic channel conditions due to demanding environmental settings (e.g., the presence of many buildings). This work investigates adaptive mechanisms to configure the communication parameters of LoRa networks in dense IoT scenarios. To this end, we develop FLoRa, an open-source framework for end-to-end LoRa simulations in OMNeT++. We then implement and evaluate the Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) mechanism built into LoRa to dynamically manage link parameters for scalable and efficient network operations. Extensive simulations show that ADR is effective in increasing the network delivery ratio under stable channel conditions, while keeping the energy consumption low. Our results also show that the performance of ADR is severely affected by a highly-varying wireless channel. We thereby propose an improved version of the original ADR mechanism to cope with variable channel conditions. Our proposed solution significantly increases both the reliability and the energy efficiency of communications over a noisy channel, almost irrespective of the network size. Finally, we show that the delivery ratio of very dense networks can be further improved by using a network-aware approach, wherein the link parameters are configured based on the global knowledge of the network.},

This is particularly challenging in industrial scenarios, where not being able to report some detected events might result in the failure of critical assets. To alleviate this, and by mathematically modeling LPWAN-based IoT motes, we have derived optimal transmission policies that maximize the number of reported events (prioritized by their importance) while still complying with current regulations. The proposed solution has been customized for two widely known LPWAN technologies: LoRa and Sigfox.

  abstract = {New verticals within the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm such as smart cities, smart farming, or goods monitoring, among many others, are demanding strong requirements to the Radio Access Network (RAN) in terms of coverage, end-node's power consumption, and scalability. The technologies employed so far to provide IoT scenarios with connectivity, e.g., wireless sensor network and cellular technologies, are not able to simultaneously cope with these three requirements. Thus, a novel solution known as Low Power - Wide Area Network (LP-WAN) has emerged as a promising alternative to provide with low-cost and low-power-consumption connectivity to end-nodes spread in a wide area. Concretely, the Long-Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) technology is one of the LP-WAN platforms that is receiving greater attention from both the industry and the academia. For that reason, in this work, a comprehensive performance evaluation of LoRaWAN under different environmental conditions is presented. The results are obtained from three real scenarios, namely, urban, suburban, and rural, considering both dynamic and static conditions, hence a discussion about the most proper LoRaWAN physical-layer configuration for each scenario is provided. Besides, a theoretical coverage study is also conducted by the use of a radio planning tool considering topographic maps and a precise propagation model. From the attained results, it can be concluded that it is necessary to evaluate the propagation conditions of the deployment scenario prior to the system implantation in order to reach a compromise between the robustness of the network and the transmission data-rate.},

In this paper, the technical differences between a wideband spread spectrum (LoRa-like) and an ultra narrowband (Sigfox-like) network will be explained and evaluated. On the physical layer, simulation results show that an ultra narrowband network has a larger coverage, while wideband spread spectrum networks are less sensitive to interference. When considering the contention between nodes and interference between different networks, simulations show that adaptation of frequency and modulation is imperative for efficiently dealing with varying contention and interference in long range unlicensed networks. Depending on network load, size and distance, a device in a wideband network can send 6 times more packets to the base station when there is active rate and frequency management and an intra-technology control plane.},

However, because the link budget in these networks is huge, nodes suffer from a near-far effect. Nodes far from the base station cannot send to the base station succesfully when closer nodes are transmitting, causing destructive collisions. LoRa, the considered technology in this paper, is a spread spectrum technology. It is known that spread spectrum is also sensitive to this effect. This paper presents a scheme to efficiently optimize the packet error rate fairness inside a LoRaWAN cell. This is achieved by optimizing the power and spreading factor for each node while avoiding near-far problems by allocating distant users to different channels. Simulations show that the packet error rate can be decreased up to 50\% for edge nodes in a moderate contention scenario where 1 node per 1000m2 transmits every 10 minutes.},

Within this family of possible technology choices, two different branches have emerged: the standards based on spreaded wideband communication and the standards based on narrowband communication, both promising to reach long range connectivity at very low power. More specifically, this paper focuses on chirp spread spectrum (CSS). This paper presents a detailed model of CSS, showing that the symbols are not perfectly orthogonal. The results show the potential communication ranges are close to narrowband networks and the robustness against interfering signals is 22 dB better for spreading factor 10 than BPSK. Although wideband communication is robust to interference, in long range communication, this robustness is insufficient due to the long range and the larger footprint. The large propagation losses due to the long range and the larger footprint make CSS prone to collisions with other noise sources, possibly larger than the coding gain.},

In realizing the vision of the Internet of Things (IoT), LPWA technologies complement and sometimes supersede the conventional cellular and short range wireless technologies in performance for various emerging smart city and machine-to-machine (M2M) applications. This review paper presents the design goals and the techniques, which different LPWA technologies exploit to offer wide-area coverage to lowpower devices at the expense of low data rates. We survey several emerging LPWA technologies and the standardization activities carried out by different standards development organizations (e.g., IEEE, IETF, 3GPP, ETSI) as well as the industrial consortia built around individual LPWA technologies (e.g., LORa\texttrademark{} Alliance, WEIGHTLESS-SIG, and DASH7 Alliance). We further note that LPWA technologies adopt similar approaches, thus sharing similar limitations and challenges. This paper expands on these research challenges and identifies potential directions to address them. While the proprietary LPWA technologies are already hitting the market with large nationwide roll-outs, this paper encourages an active engagement of the research community in solving problems that will shape the connectivity of tens of billions of devices in the next decade.},

  abstract = {The need for low power, long range and low cost connectivity to meet the requirements of IoT applications has led to the emergence of Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) networking technologies. The promise of these technologies to wirelessly connect massive numbers of geographically dispersed devices at a low cost continues to attract a great deal of attention in the academic and commercial communities. Several rollouts are already underway even though the performance of these technologies is yet to be fully understood. In light of these developments, tools to carry out `what-if analyses' and predeployment studies are needed to understand the implications of choices that are made at design time. While there are several promising technologies in the LPWA space, this paper specifically focuses on the LoRa/LoRaWAN technology. In particular, we present LoRaWANSim, a simulator which extends the LoRaSim tool to add support for the LoRaWAN MAC protocol, which employs bidirectional communication. This is a salient feature not available in any other LoRa simulator. Subsequently, we provide vital insights into the performance of LoRaWAN based networks through extensive simulations. In particular, we show that the achievable network capacity reported in earlier studies is quite optimistic. The introduction of downlink traffic can have a significant impact on the uplink throughput. The number of transmit attempts recommended in the LoRaWAN specification may not always be the best choice. We also highlight the energy consumption versus reliability trade-offs associated with the choice of number of retransmission attempts.},

One of the major drawbacks of LoRa is the data latency and the traffic congestion when the number of devices in the network increases. Especially, the latency arises due to the extreme duty cycling of LoRa end-nodes for reducing the overall energy consumption. To overcome this drawback, we propose a heterogeneous network architecture and an energy-efficient On-demand TDMA communication scheme improving both the device lifetime and the data latency of standard LoRa networks. We combine the capabilities of microwatt wake-up receivers to achieve ultra-low power states and pure asynchronous communication together with the long-range connectivity of LoRa. Experimental results show a data reliability of 100 \% and a round-trip latency on the order of milliseconds with end devices dissipating less than 46 mJ when active and 1.83 {$\mathrm{\mu}$}W during periods of inactivity, lasting up to 3 years on a 1200 mA h Lithium battery.},

  abstract = {Up to recently, two main approaches were used for connecting the "things" in the growing Internet of Things (IoT) - one based on multi-hop mesh networks, using short-range technologies and unlicensed spectrum, and the other based on long-range cellular network technologies using corresponding licensed frequency bands. New type of connectivity used in LowPower Wide Area networks (LPWAN), challenges these approaches by using low-rate long-range transmission technologies in unlicensed sub-GHz frequency bands. In this paper, we do performance testing on one such star-topology network, based on Semtech's LoRaTM technology, and deployed in the city of Rennes - LoRa FABIAN. In order to check the quality of service (QoS) that this network can provide, generally and in given conditions, we conducted a set of performance measurements. We performed our tests by generating and then observing the traffic between IoT nodes and LoRa IoT stations using our LoRa FABIAN protocol stack. With our experimental setup, we were able to generate traffic very similar to the one that can be used by real application such as sensor monitoring. This let us extract basic performance metrics, such as packet error rate (PER), but also metrics related specifically to the LoRa physical layer, such as the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and Signal to Noise ratio (SNR), within various conditions. Our findings provide insight about the performance of LoRa networks, but also about evaluation methods for these type of networks. We gathered measurement data that we make freely available together with the tools we used.},

In this paper, we highlight this aspect and present two smart city testbeds developed in Italy. The first one concerns a smart infrastructure for public lighting and relies on a heterogeneous network using the IEEE 802.15.4 short-range communication technology, whereas the second one addresses smart-building applications and is based on the LoRa low-rate, long-range communication technology. The smart lighting scenario is discussed providing the technical details and the economic benefits of a large-scale (around 3000 light poles) flexible and modular implementation of a public lighting infrastructure, while the smart-building testbed is investigated, through measurement campaigns and simulations, assessing the coverage and the performance of the LoRa technology in a real urban scenario. Results show that a proper parameter setting is needed to cover large urban areas while maintaining the airtime sufficiently low to keep packet losses at satisfactory levels.},

We systematically investigate interference interactions between LoRa and IEEE 802.15.4g networks. Our results show that LoRa can obtain high packet reception rates, even in presence of strong IEEE 802.15.4g interference. IEEE 802.15.4g is also shown to have some resilience to LoRa interference. Both effects are highly dependent on the LoRa radio's spreading factor and bandwidth configuration, as well as on the channelization. The results are shown to arise from the interaction between the two radios' modulation schemes. The data have implications for the design and analysis of protocols for both radio technologies.},

The main LPWA research directions are about large scale networks to support massive number of devices, interference issues, link optimization and adaptability. Thus heterogeneous network deployments and Spreading Factor (SF) allocation strategies need to be studied. In this paper, we investigate the performance of homogeneous networks (i.e. when all the nodes select the same LoRa configuration) and heterogeneous networks (i.e. when each node selects its LoRa configuration according to its link budget or their needs) for large scale deployments (up to 10000 nodes per gateway). For that purpose we have developed a LoRa Module, based on improved WSNet simulator, including a spectrum usage abstraction, the co-channel rejection due to the quasi-orthogonality of SFs and the gateway capture effect. Simulation results show the performance comparison in terms of reliability, network capacity and power consumption for homogeneous and heterogeneous deployments as a function of the number of nodes and the traffic intensity. The comparison shows the benefits of the heterogeneous deployment where each node selects its configuration according to its link budget.},

This flexibility provides either a long range at the cost of a lower data rate or higher throughput at the cost of low sensitivity, so a shorter range. In this paper, we analyze the flexibility of LoRa and propose various strategies to adapt its radio parameters (such as the spreading factor, bandwidth, and transmission power) to different deployment scenarios. We compute the energy consumption of LoRa transceivers using various radio configurations in both star and mesh topologies. Our simulation results show that in a star topology, we can achieve the optimal scaling-up/down strategy of LoRa radio parameters to obtain either a high data rate or a long range while respecting low energy consumption. In mesh networks, energy consumption is optimized by exploiting various radio configurations and the network topology (e.g., the number of hops, the network density, the cell coverage). Finally, we propose a strategy to take advantage of both star and mesh topologies.},

It is shown that subject to the channel composition and application requirements, a single cell may include several millions of devices. Also, we show that the capacity of the uplink channel available to a LoRaWAN node strongly depends on the distance from the base station and does not exceed 2 kbit/s. In the concluding section we summarize and discuss the obtained results, and point out few issues which need to be taken into account when making an application using LoRa or deploying a LoRa network.},

This paper proposes Hap-SliceR, which is a novel radio resource slicing framework for 5G networks with haptic communications. First, Hap-SliceR derives a network-wide radio resource slicing strategy for 5G networks. The optimal slicing strategy, which is based on a reinforcement learning approach, allocates radio resources to different slices while accounting for the dynamics and utility requirements of different slices. Second, Hap-SliceR provides customization of radio resources for haptic communications over 5G networks. The radio resource allocation requirements of haptic communications have been translated into a unique radio resource allocation problem. A low-complexity heuristic algorithm has been developed for resource allocation. Finally, a comprehensive performance evaluation of Hap-SliceR has been conducted based on a recently proposed 5G air-interface design.},

  abstract = {Recently, the increasing demand for low latency, the explosive growth in the volume of network traffic, the large and growing number of connected devices, and diversified multimedia applications have paved the way for a new era of mobile networks. To meet these diverse requirements of different businesses in network virtualization, network slicing has emerged as a promising paradigm of upcoming 5G mobile networks. Network slicing is a major technology, based on network function virtualization and software defined network technologies, which aims to achieve more efficient utilization of available network traffic and reduce operating costs. In this paper, we propose a network slicing architecture for 5G mobile networks involving cloud radio access network (C-RAN), mobile edge computing (MEC), and cloud data center. We model the proposed network slicing system based on queueing theory, which can be used to derive the main performance metrics such as the CPU utilization, system throughput, system drop rate, average number of message requests, average response time, and average waiting time. We provide quantitative examples to show how this proposed model could be applied to estimate the system performance and cost for a network slicing system in 5G mobile networks and the number of C-RAN and MEC cores required under diverse 5G traffic conditions. The analytical results and simulation models indicate that the proposed model has a powerful ability to assign the number of C-RAN and MEC cores required to achieve the quality of service targets of 5G slices.},

The CDN slice consists of four virtual network function (VNF) types, namely virtual transcoders, virtual streamers, virtual caches, and a CDN-slice-specific Coordinator for the management of the slice resources across the involved cloud domains. To create an efficient CDN slice, the optimal placement of its composing VNFs using adequate amount of virtual resources for each VNF is of vital importance. In this vein, this paper devises mechanisms for allocating an appropriate set of VNFs for each CDN slice to meet its performance requirements and minimize as much as possible the incurred cost in terms of allocated virtual resources. A mathematical model is developed to evaluate the performance of the proposed mechanisms. We first formulate the VNF placement problem as two Linear Integer problem models, aiming at minimizing the cost and maximizing the quality of experience (QoE) of the virtual streaming service. By applying the bargaining game theory, we ensure an optimal tradeoff solution between the cost efficiency and QoE. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed models in achieving their design objectives and encouraging results are obtained.},

We consider a criterion for dynamic resource allocation amongst tenants, based on a weighted proportionally fair objective, which achieves desirable fairness/protection across the network slices of the different tenants and their associated users. Several key properties are established, including: the Pareto-optimality of user association to base stations, the fair allocation of base stations' resources, and the gains resulting from dynamic resource sharing across slices, both in terms of utility gains and capacity savings. We then address algorithmic and practical challenges in realizing the proposed criterion. We show that the objective is NP-hard, making an exact solution impractical, and design a distributed semi-online algorithm, which meets performance guarantees in equilibrium and can be shown to quickly converge to a region around the equilibrium point. Building on this algorithm, we devise a practical approach with limited computational information and handoff overheads. We use detailed simulations to show that our approach is indeed near-optimal and provides substantial gains both to tenants (in terms of capacity savings) and end users (in terms of improved performance).},

  abstract = {Network slicing is one key enabler to provide the required flexibility and to realize the service-oriented 5G vision. Unlike the core network slicing, radio access network (RAN) slicing is still at its infancy and several works just start to investigate the challenges and potentials to enable the multi-service RAN, toward a serviced-oriented RAN (SO-RAN) architecture. One of the major concerns in RAN slicing is to provide different levels of isolation and sharing as per slice requirement. Moreover, both control and user plane processing may be customized allowing a slice owner to flexibly control its service. Enabling dynamic RAN composition with flexible functional split for disaggregated RAN deployments is another challenge. In this paper, we propose a RAN runtime slicing system through which the operation and behavior of the underlying RAN could be customized and controlled to meet slice requirements. We present a proof-ofconcept prototype of the proposed RAN runtime slicing system for LTE, assess its feasibility and potentials, and demonstrate the isolation, sharing, and customization capabilities with three representative use cases.},

One of the major challenges in RAN slicing is to provide different levels of resource isolation, through resource abstraction, virtualization, and splitting among different tenants/services, while at the same time providing multiplexing gains. To this end, in this work we propose a detailed approach for radio resource virtualization, leveraging different resource abstraction types. Based on it, we formulate the problem of inter-slice resource partitioning and allocation, and propose an algorithm to efficiently tackle this problem. Finally, we provide simulation results that support the benefits of resource abstraction and our proposed algorithm.},

In this paper, to make the network slicing in F-RANs work efficiently, the radio resource allocation for different network slices is exploited in a downlink F-RAN with device-to-device communication, which is logically partitioned into a high-transmission-rate slice and a low-latency slice. A multi-objective optimization problem is presented with respect to diverse QoS demands, which can be formulated as a single-objective optimization problem with a linear weighted sum method. Then an equivalent drift-plus-penalty minimization problem with Lyapunov optimization is proposed, in which two subproblems are partitioned and solved by weighted minimum mean square error approach and Lagrange dual decomposition method, respectively. Numerical results confirm that a [O(1/V ), O(V )] utility-delay tradeoff is obtained, in which either a 34.5\% reduction in the queuing delay or a 6.5\% increase in the average weighted utility can be achieved in a specific model by choosing proper values of V .},

The latter needs to simultaneously support and isolate traffic issued from mobile and machine services which may require different needs in terms of reliability, latency, and bandwidth. In this paper, network slicing is investigated in LoRa networks over fixed and dynamic slicing strategies. The performance of LoRa slices is evaluated with different spreading factor (SF) configurations. Then, a dynamic inter-slicing algorithm is proposed based on a maximum likelihood estimation that avoids resource starvation and prioritizes a slice over another depending on its QoS requirements. Moreover, a novel intra-slicing strategy is proposed that maximizes resource allocation efficiency of LoRa slices with regard to their delay requirements. An energy module for LoRa in NS3 is also implemented to evaluate the energy consumption of devices in each slice. Simulation results performed in realistic LoRa scenarios highlight the utility of our proposition in improving QoS requirements of IoT devices and providing isolation between slices.},

One of the main challenges of RAN slicing is that it is provably an NP-Hard problem. For this reason, we design near-optimal low-complexity distributed RAN slicing algorithms. First, we model the slicing problem as a congestion game, and demonstrate that such game admits a unique Nash equilibrium (NE). Then, we evaluate the Price of Anarchy (PoA) of the NE, i.e., the efficiency of the NE as compared with the social optimum, and demonstrate that the PoA is upper-bounded by 3/2. Next, we propose two fully-distributed algorithms that provably converge to the unique NE without revealing privacy-sensitive parameters from the slice tenants. Moreover, we introduce an adaptive pricing mechanism of the wireless resources to improve the network owner's profit. We evaluate the performance of our algorithms through simulations and an experimental testbed deployed on the Amazon EC2 cloud, both based on a real-world dataset of base stations from the OpenCellID project. Results conclude that our algorithms converge to the NE rapidly and achieve near-optimal performance, while our pricing mechanism effectively improves the profit of the network owner.},

  abstract = {The notions of softwarization and virtualization of the radio access network (RAN) of next-generation (5G) wireless systems are ushering in a vision where applications and services are physically decoupled from devices and network infrastructure. This crucial aspect will ultimately enable the dynamic deployment of heterogeneous services by different network operators over the same physical infrastructure. RAN slicing is a form of 5G virtualization that allows network infrastructure owners to dynamically ``slice'' and ``serve'' their network resources (i.e., spectrum, power, antennas, among others) to different mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs), according to their current needs. Once the slicing policy (i.e., the percentage of resources assigned to each MVNO) has been computed, a major challenge is how to allocate spectrum resources to MVNOs in such a way that (i) the slicing policy defined by the network owner is enforced; and (ii) the interference among different MVNOs is minimized. In this article, we mathematically formalize the RAN slicing enforcement problem (RSEP) and demonstrate its NP-hardness. For this reason, we design three approximation algorithms that render the solution scalable as the RSEP increases in size. We extensively evaluate their performance through simulations and experiments on a testbed made up of 8 software-defined radio peripherals. Experimental results reveal that not only do our algorithms enforce the slicing policies, but can also double the total network throughput when intra-MVNO power control policies are used in conjunction.},

For this reason, this article discusses a novel framework for operator-to-waveform 5G RAN slicing. In the proposed framework, slicing operations are treated holistically, including MNO's selection of base stations (BSs) and maximum number of users, down to the waveform-level scheduling of resource blocks. Experimental results show that the proposed framework provides up to 150\% improvement in terms of number of resource blocks that can be used to enable 5G transmission technologies that require coordination and synchronization among BSs.},

In recent years, WSNs have received tremendous attention in the research community, with applications in battlefields, industrial process monitoring, home automation, and environmental monitoring, to name but a few. A WSN is a highly dynamic network because nodes die due to severe environmental conditions and battery power depletion. Furthermore, a WSN is composed of miniaturized motes equipped with scarce resources e.g., limited memory and computational abilities. WSNs invariably operate in an unattended mode and in many scenarios it is impossible to replace sensor motes after deployment, therefore a fundamental objective is to optimize the sensor motes' life time. These characteristics of WSNs impose additional challenges on OS design for WSN, and consequently, OS design for WSN deviates from traditional OS design. The purpose of this survey is to highlight major concerns pertaining to OS design in WSNs and to point out strengths and weaknesses of contemporary OSs for WSNs, keeping in mind the requirements of emerging WSN applications. The state-of-the-art in operating systems for WSNs has been examined in terms of the OS Architecture, Programming Model, Scheduling, Memory Management and Protection, Communication Protocols, Resource Sharing, Support for Real-Time Applications, and additional features. These features are surveyed for both real-time and non-real-time WSN operating systems.},

Aided by virtualized control functions and control delegation features, FlexRAN provides a flexible control plane designed with support for real-time RAN control applications, flexibility to realize various degrees of coordination among RAN infrastructure entities, and programmability to adapt control over time and easier evolution to the future following SDN/NFV principles. We implement FlexRAN as an extension to a modified version of the OpenAirInterface LTE platform, with evaluation results indicating the feasibility of using FlexRAN under the stringent time constraints posed by the RAN. To demonstrate the effectiveness of FlexRAN as an SD-RAN platform and highlight its applicability for a diverse set of use cases, we present three network services deployed over FlexRAN focusing on interference management, mobile edge computing and RAN sharing.},

  abstract = {The development of applications using service choreographies is becoming one of the de facto standards for the Future Internet. However QoS-aware management of service compositions is usually performed without considering service sharing. This simplifying assumption makes choreography deployment less feasible in real scenarios, in which a single service is typically shared in many scenarios. In this paper we discuss the problem of managing multiple choreographies in multi-cloud environments and we advocate that sharing-aware deployment is a more effective and resource-efficient approach. We propose a model for the combined deployment of multiple choreographies on top of a shared set of services, and we further investigate the problem through experiments.},

  abstract = {IoT applications are usually characterized by large-scale demand and the widespread use of mobile devices. Similarly, performing interaction among application and system components in a decoupled and elastic way, and enforcing Quality of Service (QoS) usually also become issues. Hence, paradigms such as pub/sub on top of cloud resources represent a suitable strategy for application development. However, management of QoS-aware resource allocation for pub/sub systems remains challenging, especially when system peers connect in an intermittent way. In this paper, we propose a new approach for resource allocation focusing on end-to-end performance in face of peers' disconnections. We evaluate and demonstrate the benefits of our approach using simulations. QoS enforcement was achieved in almost all scenarios, and we have shown that our approach can help reasoning about efficient resource allocation.},

  abstract = {We consider the resource allocation for the virtualized OFDMA uplink cloud radio access network (C-RAN), where multiple wireless operators (OPs) share the C-RAN infrastructure and resources owned by an infrastructure provider (InP). The resource allocation is designed through studying tightly coupled problems at two different levels. The upper-level problem aims at slicing the fronthaul capacity and cloud computing resources for all OPs to maximize the weighted profits of OPs and InP considering practical constraints on the fronthaul capacity and cloud computation resources. Moreover, the lower-level problems maximize individual OPs' sum rates by optimizing users' transmission rates and quantization bit allocation for the compressed I/Q baseband signals. We develop a two-stage algorithmic framework to address this two-level resource allocation design. In the first stage, we transform both upper-level and lowerlevel problems into corresponding problems by relaxing underlying discrete variables to the continuous ones. We show that these relaxed problems are convex and we develop fast algorithms to attain their optimal solutions. In the second stage, we propose two methods to round the optimal solution of the relaxed problems and achieve a final feasible solution for the original problem. Numerical studies confirm that the proposed algorithms outperform two greedy resource allocation algorithms and their achieved sum rates are very close to sum rate upper-bound obtained by solving relaxed problems. Moreover, we study the impacts of different parameters on the system sum rate, performance tradeoffs, and illustrate insights on a potential system operating point and resource provisioning issues.},

The infrastructure provider (InP) allocates the RAN slices to the mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs), and the MVNOs then allocate the radio resources to the users. It is challenging for the InP to determine resource allocation strategy efficiently due to the selfish strategic responses of both the MVNOs and the users. To handle this issue, we propose a tri-level Stackelberg game to jointly solve the frequency and power allocation and payment negotiation problem among the three levels. Simulation results verify a general market principle that the more the MVNOs focus on revenue collecting, the lower payoff the InP and the users will obtain.},

  abstract = {LoRa is a long-range, low power, low bit rate and single-hop wireless communication technology. It is intended to be used in Internet of Things (IoT) applications involving battery-powered devices with low throughput requirements. A LoRaWAN network consists of multiple end nodes that communicate with one or more gateways. These gateways act like a transparent bridge towards a common network server. The amount of end devices and their throughput requirements will have an impact on the performance of the LoRaWAN network. This study investigates the scalability in terms of the number of end devices per gateway of single-gateway LoRaWAN deployments. First, we determine the intra-technology interference behavior with two physical end nodes, by checking the impact of an interfering node on a transmitting node. Measurements show that even under concurrent transmission, one of the packets can be received under certain conditions. Based on these measurements, we create a simulation model for assessing the scalability of a single gateway LoRaWAN network. We show that when the number of nodes increases up to 1000 per gateway, the losses will be up to 32\%. In such a case, pure Aloha will have around 90\% losses. However, when the duty cycle of the application layer becomes lower than the allowed radio duty cycle of 1\%, losses will be even lower. We also show network scalability simulation results for some IoT use cases based on real data.},

The goal of this paper is to present and examine the isolation capabilities and selected approaches for its realization in network slicing context. As the 5G architecture is still evolving, the specification of isolated slices operation and management brings new requirements that need to be addressed, especially in a context of End-to-End (E2E) security. Thus, an outline of recent trends in slice isolation and a set of challenges are proposed, which (if properly addressed) could be a step to E2E user's security based on slices isolation.},

The realization of network slicing is particularly challenging in the Radio Access Network (RAN) part, where multiple slices can be multiplexed over the same radio channel and Radio Resource Management (RRM) functions shall be used to split the cell radio resources and achieve the expected behaviour per slice. In this context, this paper describes the key design and implementation aspects of a Software-Defined RAN (SD-RAN) experimental testbed with slicing support. The testbed has been designed consistently with the slicing capabilities and related management framework established by 3GPP in Release 15. The testbed is used to demonstrate the provisioning of RAN slices (e.g. preparation, commissioning and activation phases) and the operation of the implemented RRM functionality for slice-aware admission control and scheduling.},

Both methods can be implemented by slight modification of the ordinary packet scheduling algorithm such as the proportional fairness algorithm, and guarantee resource isolation by limiting the maximum number of resource blocks (RBs) allocated to each slice. Moreover, since both methods flexibly allocate RBs to the entire system bandwidth, there are cases in which the throughput performance is improved compared to when the system bandwidth is divided in a static manner, especially in a frequency selective channel environment. Numerical results show the superiority of these methods to dividing simply the system bandwidth in a static manner, and show the difference between the features of the methods in terms of the throughput performance of each slice.},

  abstract = {The deployment of a broadband public safety (PS) mobile network can be undertaken in different ways. One method involves combining commercial networks with private ones to reduce their deployment cost and time to market. In shared commercial networks, priorities should be defined to differentiate traffic not only between consumers and PS users but also between different PS organizations and type of services. Prioritization must also ensure that emergency calls are always served under normal conditions and during disasters. The recent advent of the fifth generation (5G) wireless standard introduces new technologies, such as network slicing (NS), which allows the provision of logical PS networks in a shared 5G system wherein each slice can be dedicated to an organization or to a type of service. However, 5G management and orchestration become a challenging task with NS, e.g., in handling resource allocation between slices with diverse requirements. Therefore, efficient solutions for slice resource allocation are required to facilitate this task. In this paper, we present a review of adaptive and dynamic resource allocation leveraging on heuristic and reinforcement learning-based algorithms that have been proposed in the recent literatures. The challenge in implementing these algorithms is to find the most suitable one for our problem, i.e., an algorithm that is highly scalable, able to solve problems immediately, and exhibits the best convergence properties in terms of speed and ability to find the global optimum.},

In this context, this paper focuses on radio admission control as the function that controls the amount of radio resources assigned to the different tenants in a 5G radio access network. Specifically, a novel approach is proposed that includes profit-related metrics in the decision-making process, accounting for the additional extra incomes that can be obtained by sporadically granting additional capacity beyond the SLA level and for the penalties incurred due to potential SLA breaches. The proposed approach is evaluated by means of simulations to assess its benefits in terms of achieved profit and throughput.},

  abstract = {The growing interest in the Internet of Things (IoT) has resulted in a number of wide-area deployments of IoT subnetworks, where multiple heterogeneous wireless communication solutions coexist: from multiple access technologies such as cellular, WiFi, ZigBee, and Bluetooth, to multi-hop ad-hoc and MANET routing protocols, they all must be effectively integrated to create a seamless communication platform. Managing these open, geographically distributed, and heterogeneous networking infrastructures, especially in dynamic environments, is a key technical challenge. In order to take full advantage of the many opportunities they provide, techniques to concurrently provision the different classes of IoT traffic across a common set of sensors and networking resources must be designed. In this paper, we will design a software-defined approach for the IoT environment to dynamically achieve differentiated quality levels to different IoT tasks in very heterogeneous wireless networking scenarios. For this, we extend the Multinetwork INformation Architecture (MINA), a reflective (self-observing and adapting via an embodied Observe-Analyze-Adapt loop) middleware with a layered IoT SDN controller. The developed IoT SDN controller originally i) incorporates and supports commands to differentiate flow scheduling over task-level, multi-hop, and heterogeneous ad-hoc paths and ii) exploits Network Calculus and Genetic Algorithms to optimize the usage of currently available IoT network opportunities. We have applied the extended MINA SDN prototype in the challenging IoT scenario of wide-scale integration of electric vehicles, electric charging sites, smart grid infrastructures, and a wide set of pilot users, as targeted by the Artemis Internet of Energy and Arrowhead projects. Preliminary simulation performance results indicate that our approach and the extended MINA system can support efficient exploitation of the IoT multinetwork capabilities.},

Network slicing facilitates a cost-effective deployment and operation of multiple logical networks over a common physical network infrastructure such that each network is customized to best serve the needs of specific applications (e.g., mobile broadband, Internet of Things applications) and/or communications service providers (e.g., special purpose service providers for different sectors such as public safety, utilities, smart city, and automobiles). Slicing a RAN becomes particularly challenging due to the inherently shared nature of the radio channel and the potential influence that any transmitter may have on any receiver. In this respect, this article analyzes the RAN slicing problem in a multi-cell network in relation to the RRM functionalities that can be used as a support for splitting the radio resources among the RAN slices. Four different RAN slicing approaches are presented and compared from different perspectives, such as the granularity in the assignment of radio resources and the degrees of isolation and customization.},

This paper presents the ongoing mobile network evolution towards 5G, with a focus on the emerging network slicing concept, supposed to cope with the disparate requirements of future services and applications. Network slicing allows for the coexistence of different architectures to address disparate service requirements in a more efficient way. A slice selection function is a key element in the future core network architecture, enabling the UE to be allocated to a proper slice. We proposed a new slice selection mechanism allowing the UE to connect to multiple slices based on service type.

  abstract = {Recently released 5G networks empower the novel Network Slicing concept. Network slicing introduces new business models such as allowing telecom providers to lease a virtualized slice of their infrastructure to tenants such as industry verticals, e.g. automotive, e-health, factories, etc. However, this new paradigm poses a major challenge when applied to Radio Access Networks (RAN): how to achieve revenue maximization while meeting the diverse service level agreements (SLAs) requested by the infrastructure tenants? In this paper, we propose a new analytical framework, based on stochastic geometry theory, to model realistic RANs that leverage the business opportunities offered by network slicing. We mathematically prove the benefits of slicing radio access networks as compared to non-sliced infrastructures. Based on this, we design a new admission control functional block, STORNS, which takes decisions considering per slice SLA guaranteed average experienced throughput. A radio resource allocation strategy is introduced to optimally allocate transmit power and bandwidth (i.e., a slice of radio access resources) to the users of each infrastructure tenant. Numerical results are illustrated to validate our proposed solution in terms of potential spectral efficiency, and compare it against a non-slicing benchmark.},

In this paper, we propose a flexible cloud-based radio access network (FRAN) for TI, where traffic of user equipments (UEs) can be temporary offloaded from the operator-provided networks to user-provided networks if needed. Such a concept enables dynamic network slicing (DNS) where the network architecture is temporally augmented with slices of infrastructure borrowed from user provided network. FRAN is able to support Tactile applications without any basic change to the hardware/software infrastructure in the network. We model DNS system as a two-layer/slice traffic-aware resource allocation framework, where every layer uses a separate two-step matching game in order to serve Tactile users (TUs) and low-priority users (LUs). We propose a subgame Nash stable and two-sided exchange stable concepts as solutions of the proposed two-layer traffic-aware resource allocation. Our numerical results show that network operators and UEs (either TUs or LUs) significantly benefit from deploying the FRAN rather than conventional cloudbased radio access networks (CRANs).},

More and more vertical industries need their machines and devices connected in networks with specific requirements. In order to provide networks fitted to these usecases, and not require that they adapt to the one-size-fits-all network as is currently the case with the mobile Internet, the telecom community vowed to include network slicing functionality within its next generation of mobile networking, 5G, as an end-to-end network solution. As the concept is new and still not fully grasped, we develop and refine the concept of a network slice both from a business and a technological point of view. We investigate how network slicing in the context of a vehicular network could be implemented and how it advances the state of the art. This involves a detailed study of the involved technologies across a range of infrastructures and network segments, as well as the resulting gaps in the existing technology landscape. Based on the lessons learned in this concrete usecase, network slicing is considered in a broader 5G landscape. We capture the main challenges and potential directions in order to make network slicing a true enabler of 5G-driven vertical industries.},

However, due to the introduction of NS into radio access networks (RAN) forming a UE-BS-NS three-layer association, handoff becomes very complicated and cannot be resolved by conventional policies. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement LEarning based Smart handoff policy with data Sharing, named LESS, to reduce handoff cost while maintaining user QoS requirements in RAN slicing. Considering the large action space introduced by multiple users and the data sparsity problem due to user mobility, LESS is designed to have two components: 1) LESS-DL, a modified distributed Q-learning algorithm with small action space to make handoff decisions; 2) LESS-DS, a data sharing mechanism using limited data to improve the accuracy of handoff decisions made by LESS-DL. The proposed LESS mechanism uses LESS-DL to choose both the target base station and NS when a handoff occurs, and then updates the Q-values of each user according to LESS-DS. Numerical results show that in typical scenarios, LESS can significantly reduce the handoff cost when compared with traditional handoff policies without learning.},

  abstract = {Network slicing in fog radio access networks (FRANs) is recognized as a cost-efficient solution to support future diverse use cases. However, with the number of user equipments (UEs) fast increasing, the centralized resource allocation architecture for network slicing can put heavy burdens on the global radio resource manager (GRRM), and meanwhile slice customization is not easy to achieve. To overcome the two issues, a hierarchical radio resource allocation architecture is proposed in this paper, where the GRRM is responsible for allocating subchannels to local radio resource managers (LRRMs) in slices, which then allocate the assigned resources to their UEs. Under this architecture, a hierarchical resource allocation problem is formulated, and the problem is further modeled as a Stakelberg game with the GRRM as the leader and LRRMs as followers, considering the hierarchy between the GRRM and LRRMs. Due to the NP-hardness of the followers' problems, a process based on exhaustive search is first proposed to achieve the Stackelberg equilibrium (SE). Nevertheless, when the network scale is large, achieving SE within limited decision making time is impractical for game players. Facing this challenge, the GRRM and LRRMs are seen as bounded rational players, and low complexity algorithms are developed to help them achieve local optimal solutions that lead to a weak version of SE. Simulation results show that there exists a tradeoff between the performance of slices, and the low complexity algorithms achieve close performance to that of exhaustive search and outperform other baselines significantly.},

In this paper, we investigate the joint sub-carrier allocation and caching placement for two network slices, and an average delay optimization problem for one slice with user data rate guarantee for the other slice is formulated, which can be solved by a two-step iterative algorithm. The core idea is to optimize decoupled variables iteratively via Hungarian method, linear integer programming, and geometric programming(GP) with the help of decomposition. Simulation results reveal a fast convergence speed and a near-optimal performance of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract = {To meet diverse quality of service (QoS) requirements in fifth generation (5G) wireless networks, network slicing is proposed as a cost-efficient way to allow operators to provide customized services. On the other hand, fog radio access network (F-RAN) has emerged as a promising network architecture to satisfy different QoS requirements in distinct application scenarios. To make the network slicing work more efficiently, a downlink F-RAN, equipped with a ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) slice and an enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) slice logically, is concerned in this paper. A delayaware resource allocation optimization problem is formulated, aiming to maximize the throughput of the eMBB slice as well as guarantee the queuing delay performance of the URLLC slice. The delay-aware optimization problem is reformulated as a perslot joint resource block (RB) and power allocation problem, which is addressed by Lagrange dual decomposition method. Simulation results show a tradeoff between the throughput and the queuing delay of eMBB slice can be achieved while satisfying the delay constraint of URLLC slice.},

  abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the domain of physical/logical objects connected to the Internet that can be accessible anywhere and anytime, giving the access policies. Web objects and services can be seen as distributed and cooperative agents that need to collaborate in order to reach advanced functionalities and also to optimize the overall quality offered to the end users. However, the number of the services that can be supplied through these devices on the Internet will increase more and more. In this context, performing the composition and selection of the best services according to quality-of-service (QoS) criteria become a complex task, especially when dealing with global service selection to satisfy global constraints of users in decentralized environments. For this purpose, we propose a distributed and optimal QoS selection approach based on the multiagent paradigm and the distributed constraint optimization problem (DCOP) formalism. Hence, we revisited a DCOP technique for developing an efficient algorithm: the DPOP4QoS implemented under a real-time Web protocol for IoT communication, the extensible messaging and presence protocol. The proposed algorithm takes into account the specificities of the service composition context and the satisfaction of the global user constraints. This paper also presents a set of experiments conducted under realistic distributed environment to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm.},

In this chapter, we intend to survey all the relevant aspects of network slicing, with the focus on networking technologies such as Software-defined networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) in 5G, Fog/Edge and Cloud Computing platforms. To build the required background, this chapter begins with a brief overview of 5G, Fog/Edge and Cloud computing, and their interplay.

  abstract = {Wireless network slicing (i.e., network virtualization) is one of the potential technologies for addressing the issue of rapidly growing demand in mobile data services related to 5G cellular networks. It logically decouples the current cellular networks into two entities; infrastructure providers (InPs) and mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs). The resources of base stations (e.g., resource blocks, transmission power, antennas) which are owned by the InP are shared to multiple MVNOs who need resources for their mobile users. Specifically, the physical resources of an InP are abstracted into multiple isolated network slices, which are then allocated to MVNO's mobile users. In this paper, two-level allocation problem in network slicing is examined, whilst enabling efficient resource utilization, interslice isolation (i.e., no interference amongst slices), and intraslice isolation (i.e., no interference between users in the same slice). A generalized Kelly mechanism (GKM) is also designed, based on which the upper level of the resource allocation issue (i.e., between the InP and MVNOs) is addressed. The benefit of using such a resource bidding and allocation framework is that the seller (InP) does not need to know the true valuation of the bidders (MVNOs). For solving the lower level of resource allocation issue (i.e., between MVNOs and their mobile users), the optimal resource allocation is derived from each MVNO to its mobile users by using KKT conditions. Then, bandwidth resources are allocated to the users of MVNOs. Finally, the results of simulation are presented to verify the theoretical analysis of our proposed two-level resource allocation problem in wireless network slicing.},

These applications along with a massive number of mobile phones produce large amounts of data, bringing tremendous challenges for network slicing performance. From another perspective, this huge amount of data also offers a new opportunity for the management of network slicing resources. Leveraging the knowledge and insights retrieved from the data, we develop a novel Machine Learning-based scheme for dynamic resource scheduling for networks slicing, aiming to achieve automatic and efficient resource optimisation and End-to-End (E2E) service reliability. However, it is difficult to obtain the userrelated data, which is crucial to understand the user behaviour and requests, due to the privacy issue. Therefore, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is leveraged to extract knowledge from experience by interacting with the network and enable dynamic adjustment of the resources allocated to various slices in order to maximise the resource utilisation while guaranteeing the Quality-of-Service (QoS). The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed resource scheduling scheme can dynamically allocate resources for multiple slices and meet the corresponding QoS requirements.},

Furthermore, a neural network (NN) based 3C resource allocation algorithm is designed to provide resource allocation decision for the NS architecture. With the aid of data pre-processing techniques, fast resource allocation decisions can be made by the NN aided NS architecture. Meanwhile, the performance of the proposed NS architecture is investigated in a testbed environment. Experimental results obtained from the testbed demonstrate that the system performance of the NN aided NS architecture can be improved by function fitting based pre-processing approaches.

To solve this challenge, enhanced network slicing in F-RANs, called access slicing, is proposed. This article comprehensively presents a novel architecture and related key techniques for access slicing in F-RANs. The proposed hierarchical architecture of access slicing consists of a centralized orchestration layer and a slice instance layer, which makes access slicing adaptively implementable in a convenient way.

By extending SDN to wireless networks, software-defined wireless network (SDWN) consisting of both RANs and CN can be obtained. In this paper, the RANs and CN of SDWN are virtualized to virtual access points (VAPs) and network slices respectively based on NV technology. Considering the system scenario that a SDWN consists of overlapping RANs, an optimal joint YAP and network slice selection scheme is proposed. To characterize the complicated transmission performance of YAPs and network slices, the concepts of utility function and network calculus are introduced, and the joint utility of YAPs and network slices is formulated based on which the optimal YAP and network slice combination corresponding to the maximal joint utility can be selected.

Resource scheduling is of vital importance for improving resourcemultiplexing gain among slices while meeting specific service requirements for radio access network (RAN) slicing. Unfortunately, due to the performance isolation, diversified service requirements, and network dynamics (including user mobility and channel states), resource scheduling in RAN slicing is very challenging. In this paper, we propose an intelligent resource scheduling strategy (iRSS) for 5G RAN slicing. The main idea of an iRSS is to exploit a collaborative learning framework that consists of deep learning (DL) in conjunction with reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, DL is used to perform large time-scale resource allocation, whereas RL is used to perform online resource scheduling for tackling small time-scale network dynamics, including inaccurate prediction and unexpected network states. Depending on the amount of available historical traffic data, an iRSS can flexibly adjust the significance between the prediction and online decision modules for assisting RAN in making resource scheduling decisions. Numerical results show that the convergence of an iRSS satisfies online resource scheduling requirements and can significantly improve resource utilization while guaranteeing performance isolation between slices, compared with other benchmark algorithms.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a dynamic radio resource slicing framework is presented for a two-tier heterogeneous wireless network (HetNet). Through software-defined networking (SDN)enabled wireless network function virtualization (NFV), radio spectrum resources of heterogeneous wireless networks are partitioned into different bandwidth slices for different base stations (BSs). This framework facilitates spectrum sharing among heterogeneous BSs and achieves differentiated quality-of-service (QoS) provisioning for data service and machine-to-machine (M2M) service in the presence of network load dynamics. To determine the set of optimal bandwidth slicing ratios and optimal BS-device association patterns, a network utility maximization problem is formulated with the consideration of different traffic statistics and QoS requirements, location distribution for end devices, varying device locations, load conditions in each cell, and inter-cell interference. For tractability, the optimization problem is transformed to a biconcave maximization problem. An alternative concave search (ACS) algorithm is then designed to solve for a set of partial optimal solutions. Simulation results verify the convergence property and display low complexity of the ACS algorithm. It is demonstrated that the proposed radio resource slicing framework outperforms the two other resource slicing schemes in terms of low communication overhead, high spectrum utilization, and high aggregate network utility.},

  abstract = {Long Range (LoRa) is a popular technology used to construct Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) networks. Given the popularity of LoRa it is likely that multiple independent LoRa networks are deployed in close proximity. In this situation, neighbouring networks interfere and methods have to be found to combat this interference. In this paper we investigate the use of directional antennae and the use of multiple base stations as methods of dealing with inter-network interference. Directional antennae increase signal strength at receivers without increasing transmission energy cost. Thus, the probability of successfully decoding the message in an interference situation is improved. Multiple base stations can alternatively be used to improve the probability of receiving a message in a noisy environment. We compare the effectiveness of these two approaches via simulation. Our findings show that both methods are able to improve LoRa network performance in interference settings. However, the results show that the use of multiple base stations clearly outperforms the use of directional antennae. For example, in a setting where data is collected from 600 nodes which are interfered by four networks with 600 nodes each, using three base stations improves the Data Extraction Rate (DER) from 0.24 to 0.56 while the use of directional antennae provides an increase to only 0.32.},

  abstract = {LoRaWAN is one of the low power wide area network (LPWAN) technologies that have received significant attention by the research community in the recent years. It offers low-power, low-data rate communication over a wide range of covered area. In the past years, the number of publications regarding LoRa and LoRaWAN has grown tremendously. This paper provides an overview of research work that has been published from 2015 to September 2018 and that is accessible via Google Scholar and IEEE Explore databases. First, a detailed description of the technology is given, including existing security and reliability mechanisms. This literature overview is structured by categorizing papers according to the following topics: (i) physical layer aspects; (ii) network layer aspects; (iii) possible improvements; and (iv) extensions to the standard. Finally, a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) analysis is presented along with the challenges that LoRa and LoRaWAN still face.},

Unfortunately, in some countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, Internet access cannot be taken for granted, therefore, TTN might not be available. Moreover, low-cost and low-power consumption options devices are the most sustainable ones. In this paper, we propose a LoRaWAN network with autonomous base stations that can work without Internet connectivity for essential services, while being able to provide additional features whenever Internet access becomes available, even in an intermittent fashion. Security and privacy are preserved, with support for mobile nodes.},

  abstract = {New transceiver technologies have emerged which enable power efficient communication over very long distances. Examples of such Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) technologies are LoRa, Sigfox and Weightless. A typical application scenario for these technologies is city wide meter reading collection where devices send readings at very low frequency over a long distance to a data concentrator (one-hop networks). We argue that these transceivers are potentially very useful to construct more generic Internet of Things (IoT) networks incorporating multi-hop bidirectional communication enabling sensing and actuation. Furthermore, these transceivers have interesting features not available with more traditional transceivers used for IoT networks which enable construction of novel protocol elements. In this paper we present a performance and capability analysis of a currently available LoRa transceiver. We describe its features and then demonstrate how such transceiver can be put to use efficiently in a wide-area application scenario. In particular we demonstrate how unique features such as concurrent non-destructive transmissions and carrier detection can be employed. Our deployment experiment demonstrates that 6 LoRa nodes can form a network covering 1.5 ha in a built up environment, achieving a potential lifetime of 2 year on 2 AA batteries and delivering data within 5 s and reliability of 80\%.},

We obtained three key results, namely: (i) LoRaWAN networks are particularly vulnerable to jamming attacks, we have shown that the network throughput of the simulation scenarios chosen can be decreased by {$\sim$} 56\% when 25 jammers send unauthenticated packets permanently in the network, (ii) the gateway's performance is dramatically affected as a consequence of jammers. Our results suggest that the resources used to process packets coming from jammers could be 100 times higher than that of regular end-devices, and (iii) the network performance impact of jammers is highly correlated with the jammer class. We have shown that channel-oblivious jammers impacts the network performance widely, while channel-aware jammers impact the network locally. For this, we propose an ns-3 LoRaWAN module extension incorporating jamming attacks.},

  abstract = {Contemporary multimedia consumer devices are increasingly obtaining network connectivity mostly through wireless means. In order to economically support the mobile lifestyle of users, a new class of multimodal consumer devices has emerged that are equipped with heterogeneous wireless access capability. Inter-working of heterogeneous packet switched wireless networks, e.g., cellular and WLANs, via IP is a key step to provide ubiquitous service delivery via seamless connectivity of consumer devices. These wireless networks have a diverse range of capabilities and therefore selection of a specific network to optimize service delivery is an issue. Various algorithms have been proposed for use in the decision making process, with the class of Multi Attribute Decision Making (MADM) methods being one of the most promising. MADM methods, however, are known to suffer from ranking abnormalities. This paper applies TOPSIS, a MADM algorithm, to the problem of network selection. The causes of ranking abnormalities in TOPSIS are analyzed. An improvement to the algorithm as applied to the problem of network selection, where only the top ranking alternatives are considered important for decision making, is proposed. The new approach iteratively applies TOPSIS to the problem, removing the bottom ranked candidate network after each iteration. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed iterative TOPSIS approach.},

Selection of an appropriate transmission rate plays a significant role in determining the overall efficiency of a communication system. The technique which determines the channel state information and accordingly selects an appropriate transmission rate is called rate-adaptation protocol. The IEEE 802.11 standard does not provide standard specification for implementing a rate-adaptation protocol for its multi-rate capable wireless stations. Due to the lack of standard specification, there is a myriad of rate-adaptation protocols, proposed by industry and various research institutes. This paper surveys the existing rate-adaptation schemes, discusses various features which contribute significantly in the process of rate-adaptation, the timing constraints on such schemes, and the performance gains in terms of throughput, delay and energy efficiency; which can be gained by the use of rate-adaptation. The paper also discusses the implication of rate-adaptation schemes on the performance of overall communication and identifies existing research challenges in the design of rate-adaptation schemes.},

  abstract = {The vision of next generation 5G wireless communications lies in providing very high data rates (typically of Gbps order), extremely low latency, manifold increase in base station capacity, and significant improvement in users' perceived quality of service (QoS), compared to current 4G LTE networks. Ever increasing proliferation of smart devices, introduction of new emerging multimedia applications, together with an exponential rise in wireless data (multimedia) demand and usage is already creating a significant burden on existing cellular networks. 5G wireless systems, with improved data rates, capacity, latency, and QoS are expected to be the panacea of most of the current cellular networks' problems. In this survey, we make an exhaustive review of wireless evolution toward 5G networks. We first discuss the new architectural changes associated with the radio access network (RAN) design, including air interfaces, smart antennas, cloud and heterogeneous RAN. Subsequently, we make an in-depth survey of underlying novel mm-wave physical layer technologies, encompassing new channel model estimation, directional antenna design, beamforming algorithms, and massive MIMO technologies. Next, the details of MAC layer protocols and multiplexing schemes needed to efficiently support this new physical layer are discussed. We also look into the killer applications, considered as the major driving force behind 5G. In order to understand the improved user experience, we provide highlights of new QoS, QoE, and SON features associated with the 5G evolution. For alleviating the increased network energy consumption and operating expenditure, we make a detail review on energy awareness and cost efficiency. As understanding the current status of 5G implementation is important for its eventual commercialization, we also discuss relevant field trials, drive tests, and simulation experiments. Finally, we point out major existing research issues and identify possible future research directions.},

  abstract = {Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs) are prominent technologies in the field of the Internet of Things (loT). Due to the long range capabilities and low energy consumption, Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs) are the ideal technologies to send small data occasionally. With their unique characteristics, LPWANs can be used in many applications and in different environments such as urban, rural and even indoor. The work in this paper presents a study on the LPWAN LoRa technology, by testing and evaluating its range, signal quality properties and its performance in delivering data. Three distinct scenarios are proposed and tested, one rural and two urban scenarios in Portugal. The maximum communication range achieved was 5660 meters for the rural scenario and around 2000 meters for the urban ones, and we concluded that there are three essential scenario characteristics that influence the achieved results: distance, elevation difference and obstacles in the signal path.},

LoRaTM is one of the LPWAN and it is gaining quite a lot of commercial traction. The modulation underlying LoRa is patented and has never been described theoretically. The aim of this paper is to give the first rigorous mathematical signal processing description of the modulation and demodulation processes. We provide as well a theoretical derivation of the optimum receiver entailing a low-complexity demodulation process, resorting to the Fast Fourier Transform. We compare then the performance of the LoRa modulation and the FSK modulation both in an AWGN and a frequency selective channel, showing the superiority of the LoRa modulation in the frequency selective channel. The results of this paper will enable a further assessment of the LoRa based networks, much more rigorous than what has been done until now.},

  abstract = {Spectrum decision is the ability of a cognitive radio (CR) system to select the best available spectrum band to satisfy dynamic spectrum access network (DSAN) users' quality of service (QoS) requirements without causing harmful interference to primary users. In order to have reliable spectrum decision, CR nodes or secondary users (SUs) should identify available spectrum bands and from these candidate spectrum, a SU can select channels which are suitable to meet user QoS requirements. This paper proposes an adaptive spectrum decision framework (ASDF) which is a channel allocation scheme that selects suitable channels from a list of available channels based on SU preferred options. The scheme relies on a geo-location spectrum database for identification of available chanels. Key parameters (i.e. available channel bandwidth, time, and power) are extracted from each available spectrum and tagged according to their level in order to build a matrix of available channels. Our ASDF then maps channels with SUs based on channel properties and SU preferred options. Simulation results show that our ASDF is reliable and consistent when it comes to channel selection. Furthermore, our scheme provides efficient bandwidth utilization when compared to the first come first serve channel allocation scheme.},

An overwhelmingly large amount of services may demand some or all of these interfaces' available resources. Herein, we present a precise mathematical formulation of assigning services to interfaces with heterogeneous resources in one or more rounds. For reasonable instance sizes, the presented formulation produces optimal solutions for this computationally hard problem. We prove the NP-Completeness of the problem and develop two algorithms to approximate the optimal solution for big instance sizes. The first algorithm allocates the most demanding service requirements first, considering the average cost of interfaces resources. The second one calculates the demanding resource shares and allocates the most demanding of them first by choosing randomly among equally demanding shares. Finally, we provide simulation results giving insight into services splitting over different interfaces for both cases.},
